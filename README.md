## üì∞ News 

- **2025-07-13**: We update [`spider2-snow.jsonl`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/spider2-snow/spider2-snow.jsonl) to resolve ambiguities, with the previous version renamed to [`spider2-snow-0713.jsonl`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/spider2-snow/spider2-snow-0713.jsonl) for reference.

- **2025-06-10**: We implemented a [tool-call-based Spider-Agent](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/methods/spider-agent-tc) for Spider 2.0-Snow that requires no Docker and significantly improves runtime performance.

- **2025-05-22**: We have created a new task setting, `Spider2-DBT`, and removed the original Spider2 setting. [spider2-dbt](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-dbt) consists of only 68 tasks, enabling quick and smooth benchmarking with [spider-agent-dbt](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/methods/spider-agent-dbt). It is a comprehensive, repository-level text-to-SQL task.

- **2025-04-20**: We provide the [ground-truth tables](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/methods/gold-tables) for spider2-lite and spider2-snow to help quick benchmarking and analysis. However, when using this setting, you must indicate that you are using `oracle tables`.

- **2025-01-10**: Please refer to the [data update log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a69mxO7m1nMndXp8H_-aggvYDbcbiS3rV9GPXEw-DeM/edit?usp=sharing) to track changes in the evaluation examples. The [leaderboard](https://spider2-sql.github.io/) results will also change dynamically accordingly.

<!-- - **2025-01-07**: Please note that we do not recommend using the Spider 2.0 Gold SQL we released for SFT, as it may affect the fairness of evaluation and hinder better benchmarking of the model's SQL capabilities. The release of Gold SQL is intended to help users design prompts.

- **2024-12-26**: **Using Spider-Agent to benchmark your LLMs!** Considering the widespread attention to the traditional text-to-SQL setting, we now recommend using [spider-agent-lite](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/methods/spider-agent-lite) and [spider-agent-snow](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/methods/spider-agent-snow) to work with [spider2-lite](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/evaluation_suite) and [spider2-snow](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-snow/evaluation_suite) for benchmarking your LLMs. The final output should be CSV files, not SQLs. -->

- **2024-12-24**: Considering the many evaluation requirements, we have decided to **release all examples and gold answers for self-evaluation**. However, only a small amount of gold SQL is available. The leaderboard is still active. To have your method officially validated and upload your scores to the leaderboard, please follow the [submission guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCobAqJZcko-Vl3biOycwvCIR7kTwBPrhsgVfvaX1Fg/edit?usp=sharing).

<!-- ### Why Spider 2.0?

In 2018, we introduced [Spider 1.0](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider), [SParC](https://yale-lily.github.io/sparc), and [CoSQL](https://yale-lily.github.io/cosql) as part of the Yale Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Challenge Series, attracting over 300 submissions from leading research labs worldwide.

Now, in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), we present Spider 2.0 to advance code generation, particularly text-to-SQL capabilities.

This new benchmark offers a more realistic and challenging test of LLMs' performance on complex enterprise-level text-to-SQL workflows, involving complex data environments (e.g., >3000 columns), multiple SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), and diverse operations (e.g., transformation, analytics).

Notably, as shown below, even the most advanced LLMs, including GPT-4, solve only 6.0% of Spider 2.0 tasks, compared to 86.6% on Spider 1.0 and 57.4% on BIRD, highlighting the significant challenges posed by Spider 2.0.

|                 | Spider 1.0 dev | Spider 1.0 test | BIRD test | Spider 2.0-lite | Spider 2.0-snow |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | --------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| DailSQL + GPT-4 | 82.4           | 86.6            | 57.4      | 5.6             | 2.2             |
| CodeS-15B       | 85.4           | -               | 59.3      | 0.7             | 0.0             | -->


### Data

The questions/instructions are in [spider2-lite.jsonl](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/spider2-lite/spider2-lite.jsonl) and [spider2-snow.jsonl](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/spider2-snow/spider2-snow.jsonl).

We also release some gold SQLs to help users design prompts and methods, **note that we do not recommend using the Spider 2.0 Gold SQL we released for fine-tuning**.
