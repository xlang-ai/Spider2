First, run `ls` to see which files are in the current folder.
1. To begin with, you MUST check query.py, README.md, result.csv (if present) first. If there are other markdown files in the /workspace directory, you also need to read them, as they may contain useful information for answering your questions.
2. You should `ls` the `DB_schema` folder, which contains one or more dataset directories for the databases. Each directory in `DB_schema` includes a `DDL.csv` file with the database's DDL, along with JSON files that contain the column names, column types, column descriptions and sample rows for individual tables. please check them. Begin by reviewing the `DDL.csv` file in each directory, then selectively examine the JSON files of tables as needed. You may not need to get table names or sample rows to write SQL, as they are already include in each table's JSON files. You can use 'cat' to view the JSON file you're interested in.
3. Use BIGQUERY_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database. Do not use this action to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA; the schema information is all stored in the DB_schema folder. When you have doubts about the schema, you can repeatedly refer to the DB_schema folder.
4. Be prepared to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved.
5. Focus on SQL queries rather than frequently using Bash commands like grep and cat, though they can be used when necessary.
6. If you encounter an SQL error, reconsider the database information and your previous queries, then adjust your SQL accordingly. Don't output same SQL queries repeatedly!!!!
7. Make sure you get valid results, not an empty file. Once the results are stored in `result.csv`, ensure the file contains data. If it is empty or just table header, it means your SQL query is incorrect!
8. The final result should be a final answer, not an .sql file, a calculation, an idea, or merely an intermediate step. If the answer is a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. If not, directly provide the answer in text form, not just the SQL statement.

# LocalDB-Query #
First, run `ls` to identify the database, if there is a 'result.csv' in the initial folder, check it, the format of your answer must match it.
Then explore the SQLite/DuckDB database on your own.
I recommend using `LOCAL_DB_SQL` to explore the database and obtain the final answer.
Make sure to fully explore the table's schema before writing the SQL query, otherwise your query may contain many non-existent tables or columns.
Be ready to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved and terminate. 
The final result should be a final answer, not an .sql file, a calculation, an idea, or merely an intermediate step. If it's a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. Otherwise, terminate with the answer in text form, not the SQL statement.
When you get the result.csv, think carefully—it may not be the correct answer.

1. **For dbt projects**, first read the dbt project files and write SQL queries to handle the data transformation and solve the task.
2. All necessary data is stored in the **DuckDB**. You can use LOCAL_DB_SQL to explore the database.
3. **Solve the task** by reviewing the YAML files, understanding the task requirements, understanding the database and identifying the SQL transformations needed to complete the project. The project is a
4. The project is an unfinished project. You need to understand the task  and refer to the YAML file to identify which defined model SQLs are incomplete. You must complete these SQLs in order to finish the project.
5. do **not** use the DuckDB CLI.
6. After writing all required SQL, run `dbt run` to update the database.
7. You only need to write and modify SQL files; you do not need to modify any other files. The other files are there to assist you in writing SQL.
8. Verify the new data models generated in the database to ensure they meet the definitions in the YAML files.
9. Once the data transformation is complete and the task is solved, terminate the DuckDB file name, DON't TERMINATE with CSV FILE.
