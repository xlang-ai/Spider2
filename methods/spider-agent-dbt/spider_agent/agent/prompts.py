First, run `ls` to see which files are in the current folder.
1. To begin with, you MUST check query.py, README.md, result.csv (if present) first. If there are any other markdown files in the /workspace directory, you MUST read them, as they may contain useful information for answering your questions.
2. Use BQ_GET_TABLES to list all tables and BQ_GET_TABLE_INFO or BQ_SAMPLE_ROWS for specific details. After gathering schema info, use BIGQUERY_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database.
3. Use BIGQUERY_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database. Do not use this action to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA; When you have doubts about the schema, you can repeatedly use BQ_GET_TABLES, BQ_GET_TABLE_INFO and BQ_SAMPLE_ROWS.
4. Be prepared to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved.
5. Focus on SQL queries rather than frequently using Bash commands like grep and cat, though they can be used when necessary.
6. If you encounter an SQL error, reconsider the database information and your previous queries, then adjust your SQL accordingly. Don't output same SQL queries repeatedly!!!!
7. Make sure you get valid results, not an empty file. Once the results are stored in `result.csv`, ensure the file contains data. If it is empty or just table header, it means your SQL query is incorrect!
8. The final result should be a final answer, not an .sql file, a calculation, an idea, or merely an intermediate step. If the answer is a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. If not, directly provide the answer in text form, not just the SQL statement.

First, run `ls` to identify the database, if there is a 'result.csv' in the initial folder, check it, the format of your answer must match it.
Then explore the SQLite/DuckDB database on your own.
I recommend using `LOCAL_DB_SQL` to explore the database and obtain the final answer.
Make sure to fully explore the table's schema before writing the SQL query, otherwise your query may contain many non-existent tables or columns.
Be ready to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved and terminate. 
The final result should be a final answer, not an .sql file, a calculation, an idea, or merely an intermediate step. If it's a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. Otherwise, terminate with the answer in text form, not the SQL statement.
When you get the result.csv, think carefullyâ€”it may not be the correct answer.

1. **For dbt projects**, first read the dbt project files. Your task is to write SQL queries to handle the data transformation and solve the task.

3. **Solve the task** by reviewing the YAML files, understanding the task requirements, understanding the database and identifying the SQL transformations needed to complete the project. 
4. The project is an unfinished project. You need to understand the task and refer to the YAML file to identify which defined model SQLs are incomplete. You must complete these SQLs in order to finish the project.
5. When encountering bugs, you must not attempt to modify the yml file; instead, you should write correct SQL based on the existing yml.
6. After writing all required SQL, run `dbt run` to update the database.
7. You may need to write multiple SQL queries to get the correct answer; do not easily assume the task is complete. You must complete all SQL queries according to the YAML files.
8. You'd better to verify the new data models generated in the database to ensure they meet the definitions in the YAML files.
9. In most cases, you do not need to modify existing SQL files; you only need to create new SQL files according to the YAML files. You should only make modifications if the SQL file clearly appears to be unfinished at the end.
10. Once the data transformation is complete and the task is solved, terminate the DuckDB file name, DON't TERMINATE with CSV FILE.
