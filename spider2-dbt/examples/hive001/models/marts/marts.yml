      This model joins the cleaned COVID-19 case data with country codes to provide a more readable view of cases and deaths by country.
      It maps the `geo_id` from the COVID-19 dataset to country names using the `ref__country_codes` reference table.

      - name: stg_covid__cases
      - name: ref__country_codes
