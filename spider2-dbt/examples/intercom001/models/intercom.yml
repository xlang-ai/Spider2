  - name: intercom__admin_metrics
    description: > 
      This model aggregates conversation-related metrics at the admin (employee) level, with optional team-level data if teams are enabled. 
      Each record represents an admin and their associated team (if applicable), enriched with metrics such as total closed conversations, average conversation parts, 
      average satisfaction rating, and median response times. This provides insights into each admin’s performance, with breakdowns by team if the `intercom__using_team` 
      variable is set to true.

          # however, because admins can belong to multiple teams, this model must be at the grain of team-admin
          # so we dynamically include team_id as part of the model's primary key. if teams are not enabled, just use admin_id
