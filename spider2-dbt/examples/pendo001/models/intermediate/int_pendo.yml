      This model calculates alltime metrics for guides. This is is necessary as different kinds of guide events are tracked (whereas only
      clicks are tracked for features, and views for pages). Thus, we are dynamically pivoting out different event type metrics, and need 
      to store this in a model file (instead of a CTE in `pendo__guide`) in order to use `dbt_utils.star()`
