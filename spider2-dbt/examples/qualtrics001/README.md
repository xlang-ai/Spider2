# Qualtrics Transformation dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_qualtrics/))

## What does this dbt package do?

This package models Qualtrics data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/qualtrics). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/qualtrics#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Qualtrics source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_qualtrics_source).

The main focus of the package is to transform the core object tables into analytics-ready models, including:
- A Response breakdown model which consolidates all survey responses joined with users, questions, and survey details.
- Overview models for Surveys, Contacts, Directories, and Distributions which help to understand the nuances of each and how they affect key survey aggregations.
- A daily breakdown model which provides a high level view of a variety of Qualtrics account metrics at a daily level.

<!--section="qualtrics_transformation_model"-->
The following table provides a detailed list of all tables materialized within this package by default.
> TIP: See more details about these tables in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_qualtrics/#!/overview/qualtrics).

## How do I use the dbt package?

### Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Qualtrics connector syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **Databricks**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.

#### Databricks dispatch configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package, you must add the following (or a variation of the following) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

### Step 2: Install the package
Include the following qualtrics package version in your `packages.yml` file:
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/qualtrics
    version: [">=0.2.0", "<0.3.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```

Do **NOT** include the `qualtrics_source` package in this file. The transformation package itself has a dependency on it and will install the source package as well.

### Step 3: Define database and schema variables
#### Single connector
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `qualtrics` schema. If this is not where your qualtrics data is (for example, if your qualtrics schema is named `qualtrics_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

vars:
    qualtrics_database: your_database_name
    qualtrics_schema: your_schema_name
```
#### Union multiple connectors
If you have multiple Qualtrics connectors in Fivetran and would like to use this package on all of them simultaneously, we have provided functionality to do so. The package will union all of the data together and pass the unioned table into the transformations. You will be able to see which source it came from in the `source_relation` column of each model. To use this functionality, you will need to set either the `qualtrics_union_schemas` OR `qualtrics_union_databases` variables (cannot do both) in your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

vars:
    qualtrics_union_schemas: ['qualtrics_usa','qualtrics_canada'] # use this if the data is in different schemas/datasets of the same database/project
    qualtrics_union_databases: ['qualtrics_usa','qualtrics_canada'] # use this if the data is in different databases/projects but uses the same schema name
```

> NOTE: The native `source.yml` connection set up in the package will not function when the union schema/database feature is utilized. Although the data will be correctly combined, you will not observe the sources linked to the package models in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This happens because the package includes only one defined `source.yml`.

To connect your multiple schema/database sources to the package models, follow the steps outlined in the [Union Data Defined Sources Configuration](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/tree/releases/v0.4.latest#union_data-source) section of the Fivetran Utils documentation for the union_data macro. This will ensure a proper configuration and correct visualization of connections in the DAG.


### Step 4: Enable Research Core Contacts API
By default, this package does not bring in data from the Qualtrics Research Core Contacts [Endpoint](https://api.qualtrics.com/10b9ce5afbf17-research-core-contacts), as this API is set to be [deprecated](https://api.qualtrics.com/10b9ce5afbf17-research-core-contacts#deprecation-notice) by Qualtrics. However, if you would like the package to bring in Core **contacts** and **mailing lists** in addition to XM Directory data, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml`:

```yml
vars:
    qualtrics__using_core_contacts: True # default = False
    qualtrics__using_core_mailing_lists: True # default = False
```

### (Optional) Step 5: Additional configurations
    
#### Passing Through Additional Fields
This package includes all source columns defined in the macros folder. You can add more columns using our pass-through column variables. These variables allow for the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) and casted (`transform_sql`) if desired, but not required. Datatype casting is configured via a sql snippet within the `transform_sql` key. You may add the desired sql while omitting the `as field_name` at the end and your custom pass-though fields will be casted accordingly. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

vars:
  qualtrics__survey_pass_through_columns:
    - name: "that_field"
      alias: "renamed_to_this_field"
      transform_sql: "cast(renamed_to_this_field as string)"
  qualtrics__directory_pass_through_columns:
    - name: "this_field"
  qualtrics__directory_contact_pass_through_columns:
    - name: "old_name"
      alias: "new_name"
  qualtrics__distribution_pass_through_columns:
    - name: "unique_string_field"
      transform_sql: "cast(unique_string_field as string)"
  qualtrics__core_contact_pass_through_columns: # relevant only if you have `core_*` tables enabled
    - name: "pass_this_through"
```

> Please create an [issue](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_qualtrics_source/issues) if you'd like to see passthrough column support for other tables in the Qualtrics schema.

#### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Qualtrics staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_qualtrics`) and the qualtrics final models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_qualtrics`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled qualtrics data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

models:
  qualtrics:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
  qualtrics_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

#### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_qualtrics_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

vars:
    qualtrics_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
