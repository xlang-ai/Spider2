  - name: get_enabled_unioned_models
    description: >
      This macro takes models from the `double_entry_transactions` folder and appends them together in an array of relations if these models are enabled. This will then be unioned together using `dbt_utils.union_relations` in the `quickbooks__general_ledger` model. `int_quickbooks__purchase_double_entry` is included by default. `int_quickbooks__bill_payment_double_entry` and `int_quickbooks__credit_card_pymt_double_entry` are appended separately because their `using_` variables do not match up like the other variables, which can't be modified.
    arguments:
      - name: unioned_models
        type: list
        description: List of strings referring to particular models to then be appended and eventually unioned if enabled.
      - name: enabled_unioned_models
        type: list
        description: List of relations of models that are enabled to eventually be unioned into a general ledger model.
