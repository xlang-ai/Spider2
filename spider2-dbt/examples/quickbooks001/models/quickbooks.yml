    description: >
      Table that adds missing detail to the account table. This table adds the following:

      A financial statement helper field that specifies the account as either a balance sheet or income statement account.

      Adds a transaction type to the specified account. The transaction type (debit or credit) is the type of transaction that increases
      the account.

      Adds a multiplier of -1 to Liability and Equity accounts to offset the account balance so liability and equity accounts do not show up as
      negative balances.

      Creates a new classification field that fills in the gaps if classifications were incorrectly set on certain s. For more information 
      on how these classifications were determined you can refer to the 
      [QuickBooks API Docs](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/api/accounting/all-entities/account) that was used as reference.
