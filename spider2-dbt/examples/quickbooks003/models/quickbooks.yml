      A financial statement helper field that specifies the account as either a balance sheet or income statement account.

      Adds a transaction type to the specified account. The transaction type (debit or credit) is the type of transaction that increases
      the account.

      Adds a multiplier of -1 to Liability and Equity accounts to offset the account balance so liability and equity accounts do not show up as
      negative balances.

      Creates a new classification field that fills in the gaps if classifications were incorrectly set on certain s. For more information 
      on how these classifications were determined you can refer to the 
      [QuickBooks API Docs](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/api/accounting/all-entities/account) that was used as reference.

    description: >
      This table contains detailed balance sheet information for all asset, liability, and equity accounts, broken down by calendar year and month. 
      The data is enriched with account type, class, and parent account information to provide a comprehensive view of the financial position. 
      The data is sourced from the `quickbooks__general_ledger_by_period` table, and only entries where `financial_statement_helper` is equal to 'balance_sheet' are included. 
      It helps in understanding the period-based balances for different accounts and their hierarchical structure in the general ledger.
