    description: 
      Each record represents a detailed line item that contributes to the final charges for a given `charge_id`. These line items include specific charges, refunds, discounts, shipping fees, and taxes. The data is collected from multiple sources, such as charge line items, discounts, shipping lines, tax lines, and refund records, and consolidated into a unified table. This table serves as a historical record of all the line items associated with a charge, including the total amount and itemized details.
