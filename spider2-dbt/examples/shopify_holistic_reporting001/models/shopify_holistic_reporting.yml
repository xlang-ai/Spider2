      Table consolidating customers and their information and activity metrics from across all platforms. A full outer join is performed in order to union 
      together users who may not exist in both sources, and personal information is coalesced to consolidate as much information as possible. Includes any custom 
      columns specified in passthrough variables for both Shopify and Klaviyo.

      For **Klaviyo** metrics: Counts of instances of triggered events and sums of the numeric value (i.e. revenue) associated with events (total vs organic/not attributed 
      to flows or campaigns) will be pivoted out into columns, as configured by the klaviyo__count_metrics and klaviyo__sum_revenue_metricsvariables, respectively. 
      See the Klaviyo dbt_project.yml file for the default metrics used. These columns will be prefixed with total_count_, total_sum_revenue_ (organic + attributed), and organic_sum_revenue_ 
      (not attributed to a campaign or flow).

      Columns that come _only_ from one source will be prefixed with that source name (ie klaviyo_)

  - name: shopify_holistic_reporting__orders_attribution
    description: >
      Table of Shopify orders, enriched with a last-touch attribution model associating orders (as conversions) to campaigns or flows in Klaviyo. 

      By default, the package performs attribution [in line with Klaviyo](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005248128). 
      It considers email opens and clicks, and SMS opens as the events eligible to be credited with orders. 
      This attribution-eligibility can be configured by the `klaviyo__eligible_attribution_events` variable. 

      Similar to the Klaviyo app, the package by default considers the conversion period/lookback window for email events to 
      be 120 hours (5 days) and 24 hours for SMS events. These can be configured through the 
      `klaviyo__email_attribution_lookback` and `klaviyo__sms_attribution_lookback` variables, respectively (in integer-hours).

      Refer to the Klaviyo package [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_klaviyo#attribution-lookback-window) for more details.

      Materialized incrementally by default.
