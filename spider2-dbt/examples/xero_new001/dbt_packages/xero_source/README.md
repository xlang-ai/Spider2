# Xero Source dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_xero_source/))
# üì£ What does this dbt package do?
- Materializes [Xero staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_xero_source/#!/overview/xero_source/models/?g_v=1&g_e=seeds) which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/xero#schemainformation). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your Xero data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/xero) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Names columns for consistency across all packages and for easier analysis
  - Adds freshness tests to source data
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your xero data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_xero_source/).
- These tables are designed to work simultaneously with our [Xero transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_xero).

# üéØ How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one Fivetran Xero connector syncing data into your destination. 
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

## Step 2: Install the package (skip if also using the `xero` transformation package)
Include the following xero_source package version in your `packages.yml` file.
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/xero_source
    version: [">=0.6.0", "<0.7.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```
## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `xero` schema. If this is not where your Xero data is (for example, if your Xero schema is named `xero_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    xero_schema: your_schema_name
    xero_database: your_database_name 
```

## (Optional) Step 4: Additional configurations
<details><summary>Expand for configurations</summary>

### Unioning Multiple Xero Connectors
If you have multiple Xero connectors in Fivetran and would like to use this package on all of them simultaneously, we have provided functionality to do so. The package will union all of the data together and pass the unioned table into the transformations. You will be able to see which source it came from in the `source_relation` column of each model. To use this functionality, you will need to set **either** (**note that you cannot use both**) the `union_schemas` or `union_databases` variables:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
...
config-version: 2
vars:
  xero_source:
    union_schemas: ['xero_us','xero_ca'] # use this if the data is in different schemas/datasets of the same database/project
    union_databases: ['xero_us','xero_ca'] # use this if the data is in different databases/projects but uses the same schema name
```

### Disabling and Enabling Models

When setting up your Xero connection in Fivetran, it is possible that not every table this package expects will be synced. This can occur because you either don't use that functionality in Xero or have actively decided to not sync some tables. In order to disable the relevant functionality in the package, you will need to add the relevant variables.

By default, all variables are assumed to be `true`. You only need to add variables for the tables you would like to disable:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

config-version: 2

vars:
    xero__using_credit_note: false                  # default is true
    xero__using_bank_transaction: false             # default is true
```
</details>

## (Optional) Step 5: Orchestrate your models with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core‚Ñ¢
<details><summary>Expand for more details</summary>

Fivetran offers the ability for you to orchestrate your dbt project through [Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core‚Ñ¢](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt). Learn how to set up your project for orchestration through Fivetran in our [Transformations for dbt Core‚Ñ¢ setup guides](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt#setupguide).
    
# üîç Does this package have dependencies?
This dbt package is dependent on the following dbt packages. Please be aware that these dependencies are installed by default within this package. For more information on the following packages, refer to the [dbt hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) site.
> IMPORTANT: If you have any of these dependent packages in your own `packages.yml` file, we highly recommend that you remove them from your root `packages.yml` to avoid package version conflicts.
```yml
packages:
    - package: fivetran/fivetran_utils
      version: [">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]

    - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
      version: [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]
```
### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:
> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_xero_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    xero<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name
```
