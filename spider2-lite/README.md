# Spider 2.0-Lite

To align with research interests in **traditional Text2SQL settings**, we released Spider 2.0-Lite. This set is more self-contained, with well-prepared database metadata and documentation, making it a text-in, text-out task that supports faster development and evaluation.


## ðŸš€ Quickstart

1. Download  [local database](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1coEVsCZq-Xvj9p2TnhBFoFTsY-UoYGmG&export=download&authuser=0), unzip and put all the `.sqlite` files into directory `spider2-lite/resource/databases/spider2-localdb`.

2. To sign up for a BigQuery account, please follow this [guideline](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/assets/Bigquery_Guideline.md), get your own credentials.

3. Follow this [guideline](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/assets/Snowflake_Guideline.md) and fill out this [Spider2 Snowflake Access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbVIYcBkADVr-NcYm9fLMhlxR7zBAzg-jaew1VNRj6B8yD3Q/viewform?usp=sf_link), and we will send you an account sign-up email, which will allow you to access the Snowflake database.

4. Follow the baselines. We proposed baselines based on the widely used text2sql methods: [`Dail-SQL`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/baselines/dailsql#installation), [`Din-SQL`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/baselines/dinsql#installation) and [`CodeS`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/baselines/codes#installation).


The file `spider2-lite_0930.json` is an older version, while `spider2-lite.json` is the latest version. To address the high query costs associated with large datasets, we have sampled certain tables from `bigquery-public-data` and `patent-public-data` into `spider2-public-data`, making development more efficient and convenient.

## Data Content and Format

Each file in `spider2-lite.json` contains the following fields:
- `instance_id`: the unique example id
- `db`: the database id to which this question is addressed
- `question`: the natural language question
- `external_knowledge`: the filenames of external knowledge, documentation, and information required to answer this question are stored in documents
- 
The [`databases`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/resource/databases) and the content in [`documentation`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/resource/documentation) are resources you can use when benchmarking methods.



```
{
    "instance_id": "ga010",
    "db": "bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce",
    "question": "Can you give me an overview of our website traffic for December 2020? I'm particularly interested in the channel with the fourth highest number of sessions.",
    "external_knowledge": "ga4_dimensions_and_metrics.md"
}
```

The gold SQLs are shown in [evaluation_suite/gold/sql](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/evaluation_suite/gold/sql).



## Evaluation

We create [evaluation suite](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/evaluation_suite) for Spider 2.0-Lite.
