This data set contains log normalized gene expression counts from normal hematopoietic healthy cells from 5 pediatric donors. Data was generated using the 10X Genomics V3 chemistry and was processed using CellRanger, where reads were mapped to HG38. The 15 filtered (5 donors each with 3 sorted samples) gene-by-cell count matrices were combined into a bigger gene-by-cell count matrix. To prevent sorted progenitor cells from dominating the cell composition, we down-sampled the sorted cells to 12,000, about half of the live cells. The combined matrix was converted to a Seurat object, with the fraction of mitochondrial UMI and sample information added as the metadata. We next applied the same procedure as for integrating patient scRNA-Seq data, except using top 1,500 VEGs, the first 20 PCs, and only regressing out confounding factors of the total UMI count per cell and the fraction of mitochondrial UMIs per cell."",
