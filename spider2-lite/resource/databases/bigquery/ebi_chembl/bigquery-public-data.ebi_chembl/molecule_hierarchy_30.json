Where molregno and parent_molregno are same, the initial ChEMBL compound did not contain a salt component, or else could not be further processed for various reasons (e.g., inorganic mixture). Compounds which are only generated by removing salts will appear in this field only. Those which, themselves, have any associated data (e.g., activity data) or are launched drugs will also appear in the molregno field.",
