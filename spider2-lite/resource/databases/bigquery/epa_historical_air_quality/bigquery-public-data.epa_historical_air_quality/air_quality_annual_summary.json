So, it represents an averaging period in the atmosphere (for example, a 24-hour sample duration draws ambient air over a collection filter for 24 straight hours). For continuous monitors, it can represent an averaging time of many samples (for example, a 1-hour value may be the average of four one-minute samples collected during each quarter of the hour).",

Requested but not yet concurred means the submitter has completed the process, but EPA has not yet acted to certify the data.

Was certified but data changed means the data was certified but data was replaced and the process has not been repeated.",
