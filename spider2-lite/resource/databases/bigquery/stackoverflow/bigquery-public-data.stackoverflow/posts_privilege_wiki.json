That means once you've generated enough reputation, we trust you to edit <em>anything</em> in the system without it going through the peer review system. Not just your posts\u2014<em>anyone's posts!</em></p>\n\n<h3>When should I edit posts?</h3>\n\n<p>Any time you feel you can make the post better, and are inclined to do so. Editing is encouraged!</p>\n\n<p>Some common reasons to edit are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>to fix grammatical or spelling mistakes</li>\n<li>to clarify the meaning of a post without changing it</li>\n<li>to correct minor mistakes or add addendums / updates as the post ages</li>\n<li>to add related resources or hyperlinks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Try to make the post substantively better when you edit, not just change a single character. Tiny, trivial edits are discouraged.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I edit posts?</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>edit</code> link is available under each post.</p>\n\n<h3>What happens when I edit a post?</h3>\n\n<p>The post will be updated to show the latest editor, as well as the original author. All edits are saved and tracked in a revision history with attribution to each editor. </p>\n\n<p>The revision history can be viewed by clicking the date and time next to the edited post (e.g. \"edited 3 days ago\").</p>\n\n<p>Editing a post also bumps the question to the top of the homepage. Too many edits can also force a post into <a href=\"/privileges/community-wiki\">community wiki mode</a>. Make your edits count.</p>\n\n<h3>Reviewing suggested edits</h3>\n\n<p>In addition, users with this privilege level also get access to the suggested edits queue. The queue has a list of posts which have been edited upon by users who don't have edit privileges. This queue can be accessed over at the <a href=\"/review/suggested-edits\">suggested edits tab in the review section</a>.<br>\nUsers with this privilege level get access to the <a href=\"/review/low-quality-posts\">Low Quality Posts</a> list where they can improve the low quality posts, or suggest they are deleted.</p>",

When you retag a question, you're correcting the existing tags on the question. </p>\n\n<p>When you receive this privilege you get the ability to retag posts without having to go through the peer review system (this applied to edits that change tags and <em>nothing else</em>). When you reach 2000 reputation <a href=\"/privileges/edit\">all of your edits will bypass the peer review system</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>When should I retag a question?</h3>\n\n<p>Questions should be tagged correctly so others can more easily find them and answer them. Retag when a community member has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>chosen incorrect tags that don't properly represent the actual question topic</li>\n<li>added excess, superfluous tags</li>\n<li>created an inappropriate new tag</li>\n<li>made a mistake with tags, such as using spaces instead of hyphens</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>How do I retag a question?</h3>\n\n<p>Click the <code>edit</code> menu option under the post and add/remove tags.</p>\n\n<h3>What badges can I earn?</h3>\n\n<p>When you retag a post for the first time, you will earn the Organizer badge:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qZOgn.png\" alt=\"organizer badge\"></p>",
