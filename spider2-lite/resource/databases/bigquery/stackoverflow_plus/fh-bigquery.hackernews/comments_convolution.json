And why does it have to be a conspiracy if somebody launches a new service without freemium? You think you can compete, go ahead, compete!",

Then we switched to the OpenVPN server built into our Vyatta router, along with the standard OpenVPN client. This required a ton of manual configuration on each client, but the connections were rock solid.<p>In 2012 I helped my new employer deploy OpenVPN Access Server, the commercial version. This one didn&#x27;t need the clients to be pre-configured. Instead our employees went to a webpage, entered their LDAP username and password, and then were given a download that would do everything. The automatic configuration worked perfectly on Mac OS, Windows, and iOS. (I don&#x27;t recall if anyone tried it on Linux or Android, but I never heard any problems about those.)<p>OpenVPN Access Server is ridiculously under-priced -- it&#x27;s $10 per concurrent connection. If your usage is typical, where most users only connect occasionally, then you can connect hundreds of employees for under $1000. Even if it was a lot more expensive, my experience was quite positive and I&#x27;d still recommend this.",
