Current annual mortality is an estimate of the volume of trees dying in the year before the plot was measured, and is based on the year of death or on a modeled estimate. Periodic annual mortality is an estimate of the average annual volume of trees dying between two measurements, usually the current inventory and previous inventory, where the same plot is evaluated twice. Periodic annual mortality is the loss of volume between inventories divided by the number of years between each inventory. Periodic average annual mortality is the most common type of annual mortality estimated. This attribute is blank (null) if the plot does not contribute to the mortality estimate.",
