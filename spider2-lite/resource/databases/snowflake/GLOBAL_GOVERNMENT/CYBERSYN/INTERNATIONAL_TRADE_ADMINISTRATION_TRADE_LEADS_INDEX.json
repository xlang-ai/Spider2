The framework is split into the following Lots:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Lot 1 - General Cleaning Services\r\n\u2022 Lot 2 - Deep and Specialist Cleaning Services\r\n\u2022 Lot 3A - Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour (HPV) Decontamination Systems\r\n\u2022 Lot 3B - Ultraviolet-C (UVC) Decontamination Systems\r\n\u2022 Lot 3C - Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour (HPV) Decontamination Services\r\n\u2022 Lot 3D - Ultraviolet-C (UVC) Decontamination Services\r\n\r\nLots 1, 2, 3C and 3D will be awarded on a regional basis. Lots 3A and 3B will be awarded on a national basis.\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit ratings agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework Start Date as a base score.\r\n\r\nTo tender:\r\n(a) Go to https://www.eastmidstenders.org/; (b) Register (if not already registered on ProContract); (c) Search for tender opportunity '263_25' (via \"View Opportunities\" from the 'EastMidsTenders' Portal); (d) Express an interest; (e) Download the tender documents (from the ProContract Activity summary screen, once an Expression of interest has been completed).\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",
