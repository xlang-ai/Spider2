I'm not certain but it could be related to the way I compiled boost. The project's README recommends using <a href= http://semmel.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/boost-c-libraries-with-ios/ rel= nofollow >these instructions</a> for compiling boost into a framework but I had already done so with the <a href= http://www.danielsefton.com/2012/03/building-boost-1-49-with-clang-ios-5-1-and-xcode-4-3/ rel= nofollow >more recent instructions here</a>. Could this CLANG error be related to a boost version somehow?</p> <p>I admit relative ignorance when it comes to C++.</p> <p>If anyone has any brilliant suggestions for using the fuego library in general with xcode I have tried quite a few different things and am pretty much at wit's end. Thanks!</p> <p>EDIT: Apologies for any ambiguity here but I'm not asking about mutable references so much as showing the latest symptom of this issue.

One particular entry is a collection of those sums. I have an ng-onclick on it to run my function getLadders() when clicked. I would like it to basically pan out below wherever that element is in the chart and create new rows of the data that is in that particular element. </p> <p>A mini - drawing of the data it as I can not paste the exact data.</p> <pre><code>ID Name Total 1 Single $20 2 Single $35 3 Combination $60*** 4 Single $10 </code></pre> <p>That is the current chart with combination being the data with the many breakdowns within it. On click of that row I want it to do something like this.</p> <pre><code>ID Name Total 1 Single $20 2 Single $35 3 Combination $60*** 3.1 Single $20 3.2 Single $20 3.3 Single $20 4 Single $10 </code></pre> <p>Basically break out into everything inside that one piece. I have the function written with the extracted data I have right now plain old jQuery to select that row and append a tablerow after it but it ends up attaching it to the end of the whole table instead of at that line. </p> <p>Any help?</p> <p>Also for added benefits I also have an icon on that row that I am looking to alter as well.

We definitely want an event store but I'm struggling with some aspects of our current CQRS implementation.</p> <p>We have some complex aggregates that contain multiple entity collections and key/value pair dynamic attributes. Our existing UI has one large edit screen for this aggregate and I'm not sure how to structure the command(s) for the update.</p> <p>Possible solutions: 1) Simply fetch the aggregate in the ViewModel perform the updates against the domain model and ship it with the command (<code>var command = new SaveAggregateCommand(myAggregate);</code>). This feels wrong as the internal events would not be retained if shipping this across a serialized boundary (without custom serialization).</p> <p>2) Create one complex command object that contains a list up updated attributes and separate lists of added updated and removed child entities of each collection type. This would be the easiest for the command handler to work with but feels very sloppy.</p> <p>3) Create many commands that basically mirror the domain model's events that get captured (there would be up to 38 in my scenario). The view model would then have to keep a list of uncommitted commands that get submitted when the save button is pressed by the user. Like #2 this also feels hacky.</p> <p>Due to the (necessary) complexity of this aggregate none of these solutions feel right. I would live some guidance on this one.</p>",
