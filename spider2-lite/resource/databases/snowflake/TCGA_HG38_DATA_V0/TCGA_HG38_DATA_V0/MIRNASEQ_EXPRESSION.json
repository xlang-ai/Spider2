        "A short isomiR read may map exactly to mature strands whose sequences are similar but not identical, when the read sequence does not capture the bases that distinguish these miRNAs (e.g. hsa-mir-30a at 6q13 and hsa-mir-30e at 1p34.2, which differ at position 18). We report such a <line_feed> read as cross-mapped, and we increment the read count for each MIMAT that it mapped to. Either Y or N -- fewer than 2% are Y",
