### Refined Page Classification Criteria

#### Overview
To enhance our understanding of user engagement on our e-commerce platform, we differentiate between two types of pages based on the URL structure: Product Listing Pages (PLPs) and Product Detail Pages (PDPs). These classifications are crucial for analyzing user behavior and improving site navigation efficiency.

#### Product Listing Pages (PLPs)
PLPs are identified by specific characteristics in the URL:
- The URL must be divided into at least five segments.
- Neither the fourth nor the fifth segment contains a '+' sign, ensuring these are not detail views.
- The fourth or fifth segment must contain one of the following category names, indicating a broader category or collection page rather than a specific product focus:
  - Accessories
  - Apparel
  - Brands
  - Campus Collection
  - Drinkware
  - Electronics
  - Google Redesign
  - Lifestyle
  - Nest
  - New 2015 Logo
  - Notebooks & Journals
  - Office
  - Shop by Brand
  - Small Goods
  - Stationery
  - Wearables

#### Product Detail Pages (PDPs)
PDPs, which focus on individual products, are marked by:
- A URL split into at least five segments, akin to PLPs.
- The presence of a '+' sign in the last segment, a common marker for detailed product pages.
- The fourth or fifth segment must also include one of the specified category names, ensuring that the detail being viewed pertains to one of the recognized product categories:
  - Accessories
  - Apparel
  - Brands
  - Campus Collection
  - Drinkware
  - Electronics
  - Google Redesign
  - Lifestyle
  - Nest
  - New 2015 Logo
  - Notebooks & Journals
  - Office
  - Shop by Brand
  - Small Goods
  - Stationery
  - Wearables

### Conclusion
This detailed classification approach enables a more nuanced analysis of user pathways and interactions on our platform. By distinguishing between general browsing (PLPs) and targeted product interest (PDPs), we can tailor our content and design strategies to better meet the needs of our users, ultimately enhancing the shopping experience and improving business outcomes.
