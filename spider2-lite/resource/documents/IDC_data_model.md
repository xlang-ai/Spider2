### Data Model Description

**Collection ID**
- **Description**: Identifies the data collection to which the imaging series belongs. This ID helps in categorizing the series within a larger dataset or repository.

**Patient ID**
- **Description**: A unique identifier for the patient who underwent the imaging procedure. This ID is crucial for linking the imaging data with patient records while maintaining confidentiality.

**Series Instance UID**
- **Description**: A unique identifier for the imaging series, ensuring each series can be distinctly recognized and accessed within the data system.

**Study Instance UID**
- **Description**: A unique identifier for the study under which the imaging series was produced, linking all series and images that were part of the same diagnostic examination.

**Source DOI**
- **Description**: The Digital Object Identifier for the source of the imaging data, providing a persistent link to the source document or dataset.

**Patient Age**
- **Description**: Represents the age of the patient at the time the imaging study was conducted, providing clinical context to the imaging data.

**Patient Sex**
- **Description**: Indicates the biological sex of the patient, which is relevant in the clinical analysis and diagnostic process.

**Study Date**
- **Description**: The date on which the imaging study was performed, important for chronological medical records and tracking patient history.

**Study Description**
- **Description**: Provides a description of the imaging study, offering insights into the purpose and scope of the study.

**Body Part Examined**
- **Description**: Specifies the part of the body that was examined in the imaging study, critical for aligning the imaging data with clinical assessments.

**Modality**
- **Description**: The type of modality used to produce the imaging series, such as MRI or CT, crucial for understanding the imaging technique and its clinical implications.

**Manufacturer**
- **Description**: The company that manufactured the imaging equipment, which can be relevant for assessing image quality and technological specifics.

**Manufacturer Model Name**
- **Description**: The model name of the imaging equipment used to produce the series, providing further details on the technology and capabilities of the equipment.

**Series Date**
- **Description**: The date on which the specific imaging series was created, helping to contextualize the imaging data within the patient's medical timeline.

**Series Description**
- **Description**: A detailed description of the imaging series, providing clinical context and details about the specific focus or protocol of the series.

**Series Number**
- **Description**: A number that uniquely identifies the series within a study, used to order and reference the series systematically.

**Instance Count**
- **Description**: The count of individual image instances within the series, useful for understanding the volume of data and comprehensiveness of the imaging series.

**License Short Name**
- **Description**: The licensing terms under which the imaging data is released, important for legal use and distribution of the data.

**Series AWS URL**
- **Description**: Construct a URL that provides direct access to the series data stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This URL should be composed of the standard S3 prefix followed by the extracted bucket name from the provided AWS URL, the unique series identifier, and a wildcard to include all related files. This enables straightforward access to the series for downloading or analysis purposes.

**Series Size in MB**
- **Description**: Calculate the total size of all the imaging files within a series in megabytes. This involves summing the sizes of individual image instances initially provided in bytes, converting this total into megabytes by dividing by 1,000,000, and rounding the result to two decimal places. This metric is crucial for understanding the data volume associated with the series, which aids in effective storage and processing planning.

This comprehensive data model serves as a robust framework for managing, querying, and analyzing medical imaging data, ensuring that each element is properly cataloged and accessible for clinical and research purposes.
