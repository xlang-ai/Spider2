# Special Words Definition

## Batting Average
- Batting average is a measure of a batsman's performance, calculated by dividing the total number of runs scored by the number of times they have been dismissed. A higher batting average indicates a more consistent and successful batsman.
- Batting Average = Total Runs ÷ Total Dismissals

## Strike Rate
- In batting, strike rate indicates the scoring rate of a batsman, showing the average number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. A higher strike rate reflects an aggressive and fast-scoring batsman.
- Strike Rate = (Total Runs ÷ Balls Faced) × 100

## Wickets Taken
- Wickets taken refers to the total number of times a bowler has successfully dismissed an opposing batsman. This statistic is a core measure of a bowler's effectiveness and impact on the game.

## Economy Rate
- Economy rate measures a bowler's efficiency by indicating the average number of runs conceded per over (6 balls) bowled. A lower economy rate shows greater control and efficiency in restricting the opposition's scoring.
- Economy Rate = (Total Runs Conceded ÷ Balls Bowled) × 6

## Wickets Taken
- The number of times a bowler successfully dismisses a batsman in a single match.  This metric is a direct indicator of the bowler's effectiveness, showing how many players they were able to remove from play.

## Runs Given
- The total number of runs scored by the batting side off a particular bowler’s deliveries in a single match.  This value reflects the runs the bowler has conceded to the batting team, and a lower runs-given value is typically favorable for the bowler's performance.
