# Overtake Label Classification

In racing, overtakes are categorized into different states based on specific conditions, reflecting the circumstances in which the overtaking occurred. Below are the classifications and their detailed explanations:

## 1. R (Retirement) - Overtake during Retirement
An overtake is labeled as **R (Retirement)** if the overtaken driver retired on the same lap as the overtake. This indicates that the overtake occurred just before or during the overtaken driver's retirement, meaning they could no longer continue the race after that lap.

## 2. P (Pit) - Overtake related to Pit Stops
An overtake is classified as **P (Pit)** under two scenarios:
   - **Pit Entry**: If the overtake occurred while the overtaken driver was entering the pit lane, and the driver pitted on the same lap, it indicates that the overtaking happened due to the overtaken driver reducing speed to enter the pit lane.
   - **Pit Exit**: If the overtake occurred as the overtaken driver was exiting the pit lane, especially if the driver pitted on the previous lap and the time gap between the drivers was less than a typical pit stop duration. This suggests that the overtake happened while the overtaken driver was potentially at a lower speed, rejoining the race track from the pit lane.

## 3. S (Start) - Overtake at Race Start
If the overtake took place on the first lap of the race, and the two drivers were within two grid positions of each other at the start, the overtake is classified as **S (Start)**. This classification indicates that the overtake was part of the initial racing shuffle during the race's launch phase, where close position changes are common.

## 4. T (Track) - Overtake under Normal Racing Conditions
If none of the above conditions apply, the overtake is categorized as **T (Track)**, meaning it occurred during normal racing conditions on the track, without any external factors like pit stops or retirements influencing the outcome. This is the default classification for overtakes that happen during regular competition.

These classifications help to identify and record the context of each overtake with clarity, ensuring accurate representation of race dynamics.
