# GA4 - BigQuery Export schema

This article explains the format and schema of the Google Analytics 4 property data and the Google Analytics for Firebase data that is exported to BigQuery.

## Datasets

For each Google Analytics 4 property and each Firebase project that is linked to BigQuery, a single dataset named "analytics_<property_id>" is added to your BigQuery project. Property ID refers to your Analytics Property ID, which you can find in the property settings for your Google Analytics 4 property, and in App Analytics Settings in Firebase. Each Google Analytics 4 property and each app for which BigQuery exporting is enabled will export its data to that single dataset.

## Tables

Within each dataset, a table named `events_YYYYMMDD` is created each day if the Daily export option is enabled.

If the Streaming export option is enabled, a table named`events_intraday_YYYYMMDD`is created. This table is populated continuously as events are recorded throughout the day. This table is deleted at the end of each day once `events_YYYYMMDD` is complete.

Not all devices on which events are triggered send their data to Analytics on the same day the events are triggered. To account for this latency, Analytics will update the daily tables (`events_YYYYMMDD`) with events for those dates for up to three days after the dates of the events. Events will have the correct time stamp regardless of arriving late. Events that arrive after that three-day window are not recorded.

## Columns

Each column in the `events_YYYYMMDD`table represents an event-specific parameter. Note that some parameters are nested within RECORDS, and some RECORDS such as
`[items](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7029846?hl=en&ref_topic=9359001&sjid=16041154979191290935-EU#items)`
and
`[event_params](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7029846?hl=en&ref_topic=9359001&sjid=16041154979191290935-EU#event_params)`
