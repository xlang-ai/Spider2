## SAFE_CAST

SAFE_CAST(expression AS typename [format_clause])

**Description**

When using ` CAST ` , a query can fail if GoogleSQL is unable to perform the cast. For example, the following query generates an error:


SELECT CAST("apple" AS INT64) AS not_a_number;

If you want to protect your queries from these types of errors, you can use `
SAFE_CAST ` . ` SAFE_CAST ` replaces runtime errors with ` NULL ` s. However,
during static analysis, impossible casts between two non-castable types still produce an error because the query is invalid.


SELECT SAFE_CAST("apple" AS INT64) AS not_a_number;

/*--------------*
| not_a_number |
+--------------+
| NULL         |
*--------------*/

Some casts can include a [ format clause ](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-
sql/format-elements#formatting_syntax) , which provides instructions for how to conduct the cast. For example, you could instruct a cast to convert a sequence of bytes to a BASE64-encoded string instead of a UTF-8-encoded string.

The structure of the format clause is unique to each type of cast and more information is available in the section for that cast.

If you are casting from bytes to strings, you can also use the function, [ `
SAFE_CONVERT_BYTES_TO_STRING ` ](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-
sql/string_functions#safe_convert_bytes_to_string) . Any invalid UTF-8 characters are replaced with the unicode replacement character, ` U+FFFD ` .
