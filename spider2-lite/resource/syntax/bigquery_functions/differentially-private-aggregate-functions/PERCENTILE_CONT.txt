## PERCENTILE_CONT

WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY ...
PERCENTILE_CONT( expression,
percentile,
contribution_bounds_per_row => (lower_bound, upper_bound) )

**Description**

Takes an expression and computes a percentile for it. The final result is an aggregation across privacy unit columns.

This function must be used with the [ ` DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY ` clause
](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#dp_clause) and can support these arguments:

* ` expression ` : The input expression. This can be most numeric input types, such as ` INT64 ` . ` NULL ` values are always ignored.
* ` percentile ` : The percentile to compute. The percentile must be a literal in the range ` [0, 1] ` .
* ` contribution_bounds_per_row ` : The  contribution bounds named argument  . Perform clamping per each row separately before performing intermediate grouping on the privacy unit column.

` NUMERIC ` and ` BIGNUMERIC ` arguments are not allowed. If you need them,
cast them as the ` FLOAT64 ` data type first.

**Return type**

` FLOAT64 `

**Examples**

The following differentially private query gets the percentile of items requested. Smaller aggregations might not be included. This query references a view called [ ` professors ` ](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-
syntax#dp_example_tables) .


-- With noise, using the epsilon parameter.
SELECT WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY OPTIONS(epsilon=10, delta=.01, max_groups_contributed=1, privacy_unit_column=id) item,
PERCENTILE_CONT(quantity, 0.5, contribution_bounds_per_row => (0,100)) percentile_requested FROM professors GROUP BY item;

-- These results will change each time you run the query.
-- Smaller aggregations might be removed.
