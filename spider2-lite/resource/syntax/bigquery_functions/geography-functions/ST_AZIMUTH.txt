## ST_AZIMUTH

ST_AZIMUTH(point_geography_1, point_geography_2)

**Description**

Takes two point ` GEOGRAPHY ` values, and returns the azimuth of the line segment formed by points 1 and 2. The azimuth is the angle in radians measured between the line from point 1 facing true North to the line segment from point 1 to point 2.

The positive angle is measured clockwise on the surface of a sphere. For example, the azimuth for a line segment:

* Pointing North is ` 0 `
* Pointing East is ` PI/2 `
* Pointing South is ` PI `
* Pointing West is ` 3PI/2 `

` ST_AZIMUTH ` has the following edge cases:

* If the two input points are the same, returns ` NULL ` .
* If the two input points are exactly antipodal, returns ` NULL ` .
* If either of the input geographies are not single points or are the empty geography, throws an error.

**Return type**

` FLOAT64 `
