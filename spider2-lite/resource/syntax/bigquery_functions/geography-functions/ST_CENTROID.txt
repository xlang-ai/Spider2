## ST_CENTROID

ST_CENTROID(geography_expression)

**Description**

Returns the _centroid_ of the input ` GEOGRAPHY ` as a single point `
GEOGRAPHY ` .

The _centroid_ of a ` GEOGRAPHY ` is the weighted average of the centroids of the highest-dimensional components in the ` GEOGRAPHY ` . The centroid for components in each dimension is defined as follows:

* The centroid of points is the arithmetic mean of the input coordinates.
* The centroid of linestrings is the centroid of all the edges weighted by length. The centroid of each edge is the geodesic midpoint of the edge.
* The centroid of a polygon is its center of mass.

If the input ` GEOGRAPHY ` is empty, an empty ` GEOGRAPHY ` is returned.

**Constraints**

In the unlikely event that the centroid of a ` GEOGRAPHY ` cannot be defined by a single point on the surface of the Earth, a deterministic but otherwise arbitrary point is returned. This can only happen if the centroid is exactly at the center of the Earth, such as the centroid for a pair of antipodal points, and the likelihood of this happening is vanishingly small.
