## ST_CLOSESTPOINT

ST_CLOSESTPOINT(geography_1, geography_2[, use_spheroid])

**Description**

Returns a ` GEOGRAPHY ` containing a point on ` geography_1 ` with the smallest possible distance to ` geography_2 ` . This implies that the distance between the point returned by ` ST_CLOSESTPOINT ` and ` geography_2 ` is less than or equal to the distance between any other point on ` geography_1 ` and `
geography_2 ` .

If either of the input ` GEOGRAPHY ` s is empty, ` ST_CLOSESTPOINT ` returns `
NULL ` .

The optional ` use_spheroid ` parameter determines how this function measures distance. If ` use_spheroid ` is ` FALSE ` , the function measures distance on the surface of a perfect sphere.

The ` use_spheroid ` parameter currently only supports the value ` FALSE ` .
The default value of ` use_spheroid ` is ` FALSE ` .

**Return type**

Point ` GEOGRAPHY `
