## ST_EQUALS

ST_EQUALS(geography_1, geography_2)

**Description**

Returns ` TRUE ` if ` geography_1 ` and ` geography_2 ` represent the same

` GEOGRAPHY ` value. More precisely, this means that one of the following conditions holds: \+ ` ST_COVERS(geography_1, geography_2) = TRUE ` and `
ST_COVERS(geography_2, geography_1) = TRUE ` \+ Both ` geography_1 ` and `
geography_2 ` are empty.

Therefore, two ` GEOGRAPHY ` s may be equal even if the ordering of points or vertices differ, as long as they still represent the same geometric structure.

**Constraints**

` ST_EQUALS ` is not guaranteed to be a transitive function.

**Return type**

` BOOL `
