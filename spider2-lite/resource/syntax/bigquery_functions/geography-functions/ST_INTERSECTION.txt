## ST_INTERSECTION

ST_INTERSECTION(geography_1, geography_2)

**Description**

Returns a ` GEOGRAPHY ` that represents the point set intersection of the two input ` GEOGRAPHY ` s. Thus, every point in the intersection appears in both `
geography_1 ` and ` geography_2 ` .

If the two input ` GEOGRAPHY ` s are disjoint, that is, there are no points that appear in both input ` geometry_1 ` and ` geometry_2 ` , then an empty `
GEOGRAPHY ` is returned.

See  ST_INTERSECTS  ,  ST_DISJOINT  for related predicate functions.

**Return type**

` GEOGRAPHY `
