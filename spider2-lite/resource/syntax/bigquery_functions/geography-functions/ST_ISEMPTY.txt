## ST_ISEMPTY

ST_ISEMPTY(geography_expression)

**Description**

Returns ` TRUE ` if the given ` GEOGRAPHY ` is empty; that is, the ` GEOGRAPHY
` does not contain any points, lines, or polygons.

NOTE: An empty ` GEOGRAPHY ` is not associated with a particular geometry shape. For example, the results of expressions ` ST_GEOGFROMTEXT('POINT EMPTY') ` and ` ST_GEOGFROMTEXT('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION EMPTY') ` are identical.
