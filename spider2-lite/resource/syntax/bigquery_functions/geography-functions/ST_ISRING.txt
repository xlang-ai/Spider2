## ST_ISRING

ST_ISRING(geography_expression)

**Description**

Returns ` TRUE ` if the input ` GEOGRAPHY ` is a linestring and if the linestring is both  ` ST_ISCLOSED ` and simple. A linestring is considered simple if it does not pass through the same point twice (with the exception of the start and endpoint, which may overlap to form a ring).

An empty ` GEOGRAPHY ` is not a ring.

**Return type**

` BOOL `
