## ST_LINELOCATEPOINT

ST_LINELOCATEPOINT(linestring_geography, point_geography)

**Description**

Gets a section of a linestring between the start point and a selected point (a point on the linestring closest to the ` point_geography ` argument). Returns the percentage that this section represents in the linestring.

Details:

* To select a point on the linestring ` GEOGRAPHY ` ( ` linestring_geography ` ), this function takes a point ` GEOGRAPHY ` ( ` point_geography ` ) and finds the  closest point  to it on the linestring.
* If two points on ` linestring_geography ` are an equal distance away from ` point_geography ` , it is not guaranteed which one will be selected.
* The return value is an inclusive value between 0 and 1 (0-100%).
* If the selected point is the start point on the linestring, function returns 0 (0%).
* If the selected point is the end point on the linestring, function returns 1 (100%).

` NULL ` and error handling:

* Returns ` NULL ` if any input argument is ` NULL ` .
* Returns an error if ` linestring_geography ` is not a linestring or if ` point_geography ` is not a point. Use the ` SAFE ` prefix to obtain ` NULL ` for invalid input instead of an error.

**Return Type**

` FLOAT64 `
