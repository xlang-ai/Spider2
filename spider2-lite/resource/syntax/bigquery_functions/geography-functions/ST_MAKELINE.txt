## ST_MAKELINE

ST_MAKELINE(geography_1, geography_2)


ST_MAKELINE(array_of_geography)

**Description**

Creates a ` GEOGRAPHY ` with a single linestring by concatenating the point or line vertices of each of the input ` GEOGRAPHY ` s in the order they are given.

` ST_MAKELINE ` comes in two variants. For the first variant, input must be two ` GEOGRAPHY ` s. For the second, input must be an ` ARRAY ` of type `
GEOGRAPHY ` . In either variant, each input ` GEOGRAPHY ` must consist of one of the following values:

* Exactly one point.
* Exactly one linestring.

For the first variant of ` ST_MAKELINE ` , if either input ` GEOGRAPHY ` is `
NULL ` , ` ST_MAKELINE ` returns ` NULL ` . For the second variant, if input `
ARRAY ` or any element in the input ` ARRAY ` is ` NULL ` , ` ST_MAKELINE `
returns ` NULL ` .

**Constraints**

Every edge must span strictly less than 180 degrees.

NOTE: The GoogleSQL snapping process may discard sufficiently short edges and snap the two endpoints together. For instance, if two input ` GEOGRAPHY ` s each contain a point and the two points are separated by a distance less than the snap radius, the points will be snapped together. In such a case the result will be a ` GEOGRAPHY ` with exactly one point.

**Return type**

LineString ` GEOGRAPHY `
