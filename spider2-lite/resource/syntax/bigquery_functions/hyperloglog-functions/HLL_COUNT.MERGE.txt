## HLL_COUNT.MERGE

HLL_COUNT.MERGE(sketch)

**Description**

An aggregate function that returns the cardinality of several [ HLL++
](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub40671.html) sketches by computing their union.

Each ` sketch ` must be initialized on the same type. Attempts to merge sketches for different types results in an error. For example, you cannot merge a sketch initialized from ` INT64 ` data with one initialized from `
STRING ` data.

If the merged sketches were initialized with different precisions, the precision will be downgraded to the lowest precision involved in the merge.

This function ignores ` NULL ` values when merging sketches. If the merge happens over zero rows or only over ` NULL ` values, the function returns ` 0
` .

**Supported input types**

` BYTES `

**Return type**

` INT64 `

**Example**

The following query counts the number of distinct users across all countries who have at least one invoice.


SELECT HLL_COUNT.MERGE(hll_sketch) AS distinct_customers_with_open_invoice FROM ( SELECT country,
HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id) AS hll_sketch FROM UNNEST( ARRAY<STRUCT<country STRING, customer_id STRING, invoice_id STRING>>[
('UA', 'customer_id_1', 'invoice_id_11'),
('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_22'),
('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_23'),
('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
('UA', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_24')]) GROUP BY country );
