## NET.PUBLIC_SUFFIX

NET.PUBLIC_SUFFIX(url)

**Description**

Takes a URL as a ` STRING ` value and returns the public suffix (such as ` com
` , ` org ` , or ` net ` ). A public suffix is an ICANN domain registered at [
publicsuffix.org ](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) . For best results, URL values should comply with the format as defined by [ RFC 3986
](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A) . If the URL value does not comply with RFC 3986 formatting, this function makes a best effort to parse the input and return a relevant result.

This function returns ` NULL ` if any of the following is true:

* It cannot parse the host from the input;
* The parsed host contains adjacent dots in the middle (not leading or trailing);
* The parsed host does not contain any public suffix.

Before looking up the public suffix, this function temporarily normalizes the host by converting uppercase English letters to lowercase and encoding all non-ASCII characters with [ Punycode ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode) . The function then returns the public suffix as part of the original host instead of the normalized host.

**Note:** The function does not perform [ Unicode normalization
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) .  **Note:** The public suffix data at [ publicsuffix.org ](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) also contains private domains. This function ignores the private domains.
**Note:** The public suffix data may change over time. Consequently, input that produces a ` NULL ` result now may produce a non- ` NULL ` value in the future.

**Return Data Type**

` STRING `
