RANGE_END(range_to_check)

**Description**

Gets the upper bound of a range.

**Definitions**

* ` range_to_check ` : The ` RANGE<T> ` value.

**Details**

Returns ` NULL ` if the upper bound in ` range_value ` is ` UNBOUNDED ` .

Returns ` NULL ` if ` range_to_check ` is ` NULL ` .

**Return type**

` T ` in ` range_value `

**Examples**

In the following query, the upper bound of the range is retrieved:


SELECT RANGE_END(RANGE<DATE> '[2022-12-01, 2022-12-31)') AS results;

/*------------+

/*------------+
| results    |
+------------+
| NULL       |
