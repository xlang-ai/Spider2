## COLLATE

COLLATE(value, collate_specification)

Takes a ` STRING ` and a [ collation specification
](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/collation-
concepts#collate_spec_details) . Returns a ` STRING ` with a collation specification. If ` collate_specification ` is empty, returns a value with collation removed from the ` STRING ` .

The collation specification defines how the resulting ` STRING ` can be compared and sorted. To learn more, see [ Working with collation
](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/collation-
concepts#working_with_collation) .

* ` collation_specification ` must be a string literal, otherwise an error is thrown.
* Returns ` NULL ` if ` value ` is ` NULL ` .

**Return type**

` STRING `

**Examples**

In this example, the weight of ` a ` is less than the weight of ` Z ` . This is because the collate specification, ` und:ci ` assigns more weight to ` Z `
.


WITH Words AS ( SELECT COLLATE('a', 'und:ci') AS char1,
COLLATE('Z', 'und:ci') AS char2 ) SELECT ( Words.char1 < Words.char2 ) AS a_less_than_Z FROM Words;

/*----------------*
| a_less_than_Z  |
+----------------+
| TRUE           |
*----------------*/

In this example, the weight of ` a ` is greater than the weight of ` Z ` .
This is because the default collate specification assigns more weight to ` a `
.


WITH Words AS ( SELECT
'a' AS char1,
'Z' AS char2 ) SELECT ( Words.char1 < Words.char2 ) AS a_less_than_Z FROM Words;

/*----------------*
| a_less_than_Z  |
+----------------+
| FALSE          |
*----------------*/
