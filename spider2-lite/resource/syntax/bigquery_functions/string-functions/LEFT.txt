## LEFT

LEFT(value, length)

**Description**

Returns a ` STRING ` or ` BYTES ` value that consists of the specified number of leftmost characters or bytes from ` value ` . The ` length ` is an ` INT64
` that specifies the length of the returned value. If ` value ` is of type `
BYTES ` , ` length ` is the number of leftmost bytes to return. If ` value `
is ` STRING ` , ` length ` is the number of leftmost characters to return.

If ` length ` is 0, an empty ` STRING ` or ` BYTES ` value will be returned.
If ` length ` is negative, an error will be returned. If ` length ` exceeds the number of characters or bytes from ` value ` , the original ` value ` will be returned.

**Return type**

` STRING ` or ` BYTES `

WITH examples AS (SELECT 'apple' as example UNION ALL SELECT 'banana' as example UNION ALL SELECT 'абвгд' as example ) SELECT example, LEFT(example, 3) AS left_example FROM examples;

/*---------+--------------*
| example | left_example |
+---------+--------------+
| apple   | app          |
| banana  | ban          |
| абвгд   | абв          |

WITH examples AS (SELECT b'apple' as example UNION ALL SELECT b'banana' as example UNION ALL SELECT b'\xab\xcd\xef\xaa\xbb' as example ) SELECT example, LEFT(example, 3) AS left_example FROM examples;

-- Note that the result of LEFT is of type BYTES, displayed as a base64-encoded string.
