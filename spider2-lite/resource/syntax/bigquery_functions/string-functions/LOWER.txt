## LOWER

LOWER(value)

**Description**

For ` STRING ` arguments, returns the original string with all alphabetic characters in lowercase. Mapping between lowercase and uppercase is done according to the [ Unicode Character Database ](http://unicode.org/ucd/) without taking into account language-specific mappings.

For ` BYTES ` arguments, the argument is treated as ASCII text, with all bytes greater than 127 left intact.

**Return type**

` STRING ` or ` BYTES `

**Examples**


WITH items AS (SELECT
'FOO' as item UNION ALL SELECT
'BAR' as item UNION ALL SELECT
'BAZ' as item)

SELECT LOWER(item) AS example FROM items;
