## SOUNDEX

SOUNDEX(value)

**Description**

Returns a ` STRING ` that represents the [ Soundex
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) code for ` value ` .

SOUNDEX produces a phonetic representation of a string. It indexes words by sound, as pronounced in English. It is typically used to help determine whether two strings, such as the family names _Levine_ and _Lavine_ , or the words _to_ and _too_ , have similar English-language pronunciation.

The result of the SOUNDEX consists of a letter followed by 3 digits. Non-latin characters are ignored. If the remaining string is empty after removing non-
Latin characters, an empty ` STRING ` is returned.
