## SUBSTR

SUBSTR(value, position[, length])

**Description**

Gets a portion (substring) of the supplied ` STRING ` or ` BYTES ` value.

The ` position ` argument is an integer specifying the starting position of the substring.

* If ` position ` is ` 1 ` , the substring starts from the first character or byte.
* If ` position ` is ` 0 ` or less than ` -LENGTH(value) ` , ` position ` is set to ` 1 ` , and the substring starts from the first character or byte.
* If ` position ` is greater than the length of ` value ` , the function produces an empty substring.
* If ` position ` is negative, the function counts from the end of ` value ` , with ` -1 ` indicating the last character or byte.

The ` length ` argument specifies the maximum number of characters or bytes to return.

* If ` length ` is not specified, the function produces a substring that starts at the specified position and ends at the last character or byte of ` value ` .
* If ` length ` is ` 0 ` , the function produces an empty substring.
* If ` length ` is negative, the function produces an error.
* The returned substring may be shorter than ` length ` , for example, when ` length ` exceeds the length of ` value ` , or when the starting position of the substring plus ` length ` is greater than the length of ` value ` .

**Return type**

` STRING ` or ` BYTES `
