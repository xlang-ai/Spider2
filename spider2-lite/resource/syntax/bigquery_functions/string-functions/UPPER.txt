## UPPER

UPPER(value)

**Description**

For ` STRING ` arguments, returns the original string with all alphabetic characters in uppercase. Mapping between uppercase and lowercase is done according to the [ Unicode Character Database ](http://unicode.org/ucd/) without taking into account language-specific mappings.

For ` BYTES ` arguments, the argument is treated as ASCII text, with all bytes greater than 127 left intact.

**Return type**

` STRING ` or ` BYTES `

**Examples**


WITH items AS (SELECT
'foo' as item UNION ALL SELECT
'bar' as item UNION ALL SELECT
'baz' as item)

SELECT UPPER(item) AS example FROM items;

/*---------*

| FOO     |
| BAR     |
| BAZ     |
