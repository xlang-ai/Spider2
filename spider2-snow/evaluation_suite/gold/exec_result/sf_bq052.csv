4229202,Wastewater treatment with ultraviolet disinfection and increased capacity,1979-01-29,1,1,"The invention relates to wastewater treatment, and more particularly to an efficient on-site wastewater treatment and disposal method and apparatus utilizing filtration and ultraviolet disinfection. Various systems have been used for treatment of residential and other wastes. In cities there have typically been central sewage treatment facilities for water-borne solid and liquid wastes conducted thereto from residences and other sources. Generally these systems have included separation of the solids from the liquids, sometimes by settlement and sometimes by filtration. However, separation at this stage is only partially effective, since the solids and liquids have become nearly homogenized in transit. Such """"separated"""" solids have often been subsequently subjected to a drying operation. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,736,434 and 3,559,807. The liquids from such sewage treatment, which at this point carry many substances from the solids, have usually been chemically treated to the point that they can be returned to the soil or to flowing water. The solids have generally been either buried or composted. Composting of sewage solids at this stage is nearly always anaerobic, since anaerobic decomposition has already begun as the wastes have travelled through sewage lines to the treatment facility. This precludes aerobic composting, which often is desirable and feasible, for producing a useful compost without contaminating the surrounding air. One type of on-site sewage filtration apparatus has been suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 3,747,766. That apparatus was intended to separate solid wastes from liquid wastes soon after their exit from households or other sources. However, the system of the patent was completely closed, with no provision for aerobic composting of solids. The final treatment of the solids was to be dehydration and/or burning. This type treatment is not only costly but also wasteful of the soil conditioning product that can be derived from aerobic composting. The aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,559,807 discloses a conveyor-type filtering device which is in some respects similar to a filtering apparatus of the present invention. However, the filtering device of that patent does not include several particularly advantageous features of the present invention, and it is shown for use with solid material drying and burning apparatus. In connection with filtration sewage treatment, there has been a need for an efficient and inexpensive means of disinfecting the liquid filtrate, without destruction of nutrients, so that with minimal treatment it can be dispersed to soil as a beneficial supplement. There has been a need for an efficient, compact, and reliable wastewater separation and treatment apparatus in several areas of application in addition to sewage treatment. For example, in the food processing industry large quantities of water bearing organic materials must be separated from such materials at least to the point that the water can be safely returned to the soil. Similar problems exist with other industrial water-borne wastes. In industrial air pollution reduction equipment, solid pollutants are often ultimately carried by water. This water should be separated from the solids and purified before it is introduced to the soil or flowing water. The invention described herein is an on-site wastewater treatment and disposal system adaptable for many liquid separation applications, and particularly suited for sewage treatment for private dwellings or groups of dwellings. The basic principles of the invention are as follows: While the wastewater or sewage is still fresh, solids are immediately separated from the wastewater input by a paper filter which is dispensed by a sequentially advanced continuous roll, formed into an input trough and exhausted of its filtrate by a suction applied from below. The trapped solids and paper filter are conveyed to a composting area where they are allowed to decompose by natural biological processes. The filtrate is exposed to ultraviolet radiation to kill organisms directly and also preferably to produce ozone in the filtrate, for reaction with organisms to produce harmless, stable compounds. The disinfected filtrate is applied to unsaturated ground, beneficially adding nitrogen to the soil. By the means disclosed, a number of unique and highly beneficial results are obtained over previous wastewater processing systems: Solids are removed soon after their entry into the wastewater flow, before significant pathogen growth and while the solids still have a high degree of structural integrity and have not become """"homogenized"""" with the liquids, which ordinarily happens in prolonged wastewater transit. This immediate filtration with a very efficient disposable filter allows for a highly filtered filtrate virtually free of suspended solids, low in bacteria, easily pumped, and readily disinfected. The almost total extraction of wastewater contaminants with the filter limits the need for process decontamination to a fraction of the original wastewater volume. Thus, unlike conventional sewage treatment processes, no large tanks are needed for biological digestion of contaminants in solution. Composting of the paper with dewatered solids by either aerobic or anaerobic means provides an energy-efficient, non-polluting and reliable method for decontaminating the solids for return to the ecosphere. Where aerobic means are used, sewage solids can be integrated with other organic solid wastes for optimized composting of both. The system lends itself extremely well to the use of ultraviolet radiation to disinfect the liquid filtrate, destroying pathogens and controlling regrowth. The ultraviolet treatment is energy-efficient, since the energy emitted is only used to destroy organisms, and not to enter into energy-absorbing chemical reactions. Conversely, disinfectants which work purely by oxidation, such as chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, and iodine are inefficient in disinfecting effluents with high nutrient content since their chemical energy is largely wasted in reactions with the nutrients. Ultraviolet radiation, unlike chlorine, is highly efficient in killing viruses, even more so than in killing bacteria. The ultraviolet utilized for the invention includes a wavelength effective to directly kill pathogens by destroying the DNA of the organism, known as """"germicidal"""" wavelength ultraviolet. It also preferably includes an ozone-producing wavelength, which acts on the pathogens by a different means: production of ozone from entrained air in the filtrate liquid, resulting in the formation of stable compounds from pathogens, and the addition of residual hydrogen peroxide to the filtrate to deter pathogen regrowth. The two types of ultraviolet treatment act in concert to disinfect the filtrate more thoroughly and efficiently than the sum of their effects taken separately. The nutrients of the filtrate liquid are left in a form useful as a beneficial soil supplement. Ultraviolet treatment is particularly advantageous with this system because the filtration employed removes nearly all suspended solids, unlike settling processes, making the filtrate clearer and permitting more thorough penetration of the ultraviolet light, resulting in more efficient treatment of the filtrate. Also, the apparatus and method of the invention provide for the ultraviolet treatment immediately after filtration, before growth of organisms and turbidity can occur, and while there is significant entrained air in the filtrate for the production of ozone. This also provides for treatment at a location where the liquid flow rate is slow, for better irradiation. Suction applied to the filtration further increases entrained air in the filtrate, enhancing ozone production. The dissolved solids present in the disinfected filtrate, in the case of sewage, are primarily phosphates, alkyl benzyl sulfonates and organic nitrogen compounds, all of which are readily and productively absorbed by vegetation through the assistance of microorganisms. Nitrogen present in urine, which constitutes over 80% of the nitrogen in human waste, is preserved by this process in a liquid fertilizer; other aerobic and composting systems dissipate most of this nitrogen to the atmosphere as ammonia gas. The disinfected filtrate, being virtually free of suspended solids and thoroughly disinfected, can be readily transported by narrow diameter pressurized pipe and dispersed to unsaturated ground through trickle irrigation, spray irrigation, or furrow irrigation with little danger of soil clogging or orifice clogging. This system, unlike many proposed on-site processing systems, can be installed into existing homes without changing any of the existing plumbing fixtures. Both sanitary and washing wastewaters are processed with no need for separate handling of the two. The system may also be easily installed at existing industrial sites for separating and treating non-sewage wastewaters bearing solids. In fact, it is highly adaptable to the food processing industry, where organic materials are carried in wastewater, and also to the reclamation of water from polluted-air cleansing """"scrubbers"""" which pick up solids from the air they cleanse. For new homes, the installation of the on-site system can save considerably in piping costs. Thus, in one embodiment the process of the invention comprises separating the solids from the liquids while the sewage is fresh, and producing a liquid component low in suspended solid material; exposing the liquid component to ultraviolet radiation including germicidal wavelength, to destroy pathogens but not beneficial nutrients present in the liquid component; introducing ozone in the liquid component to react with pathogens to form stable compounds and to produce residual hydrogen peroxide for deterring subsequent pathogen growth; and dispersing the nutrient-rich treated liquid component to unsaturated ground. In another embodiment, the invention has certain modifications to a wastewater delivery subsystem, whereby filtration and pump operation are made continuous and the capacity of the system is approximately doubled. The modification involves duplication of a few tank and valve components, increasing cost and space requirements less than 20 percent. In addition, the system is readily adaptable to a modular arrangement whereby the capacity may be doubled simply by adding a few modular components and adjusting the control sequence. Thus, according to the second embodiment, the process of the invention comprises a continuous filtration process involving duplicate filtrate or power reservoirs, including pumping stored filtrate from the first reservoir to create a suction; connecting that reservoir with the holding or buffer tank to draw a charge of wastewater into the holding tank; releasing the charge to the filter medium; disconnecting the first reservoir from the holding tank and connecting it to the filtrate side of the filter medium to apply suction thereto and draw filtrate into the first reservoir; while filtration proceeds, pumping stored filtrate from the second reservoir to create a suction therein; connecting the second reservoir to the holding tank and drawing a second charge of wastewater thereto; releasing the second charge to the filter medium; while filtration continues, disconnecting the second reservoir from the holding tank and switching the filtrate side of the medium from the first to the second tank as a source of suction; and thence repeating the cycle. Accordingly, some of the objects of the invention are as follows: (1) To provide a means for conveying wastewater to a filtration station and filtering through a paper filter; (2) To provide a hydraulic/pneumatic subsystem consisting of one pump, several reservoirs, and several inexpensive valves to supply storage of incoming wastewater, pneumatic lift of wastewater to the paper filter, suction to the filtrate side of the filter, and hydraulic pressure for the treated liquid; (3) To provide efficient ultraviolet treatment of the liquid filtrate, soon after filtration, for complete disinfection of the filtrate with minimal energy requirements; and (4) To provide for continuous filtration and approximate doubling of the system's capacity where desired, through addition of modular, interchangeable components. These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the drawings."

7422682,"Compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation",2005-06-28,2,1,"FIELD OF THE ART The field of art disclosed herein pertains to compositions, devices, and methods suited for a variety of applications in environmental remediation. BACKGROUND The uses of structural barriers for a variety of applications in environmental remediation are generally well described. Several types of environmental remediation barriers (ERBs) are used in earth and hydraulic engineering, such exemplary structures including fiber rolls, mats, blankets, and berms. Originally, major applications of ERBs included erosion and sedimentation control, revegetation, and revetment. More recently, the potential for such structures to serve additionally in the capacity of removal of natural and manmade pollutants from residential, industrial, and agricultural sources, and remediation of eutrification has been described. As the name of one type of ERB, fiber roll, suggests, ERBs packed into a covering, such as a netted material, may be filled with fibers; typically a single natural fiber such as abaca, hemp, jute, flax, sisal, coir, or straw materials. For a major application of fiber-filled ERBs in erosion and sediment control, the purpose of the fiber filling is primarily structural. In that regard, though the natural fibers described are capable of absorbing water, one necessary attribute of the fiber filler has been to provide an effective porosity once packed that allows for the ready passage of water, while promoting the retention of mud, sediment, gravel, and the like. Other desirable attributes of natural fibers used in ERBs include ready availability in high volume and low cost, requirement to be germ, insect and weed free, free of chemical pollutants, ability to degrade after use; thereby obviating creation of harmful waste, and ease of processing into targeted devices. Materials in addition to natural fibers have been suggested as supplemental constituents in ERBs. Particularly, vegetative matter, as well as nutrients and fertilizers for revegetation and revetment have been described. Materials that have been suggested include saw dust, wood chips, bark, compost, flocculants, water absorbents, and pesticides. A major objective in the field has been to establish environmental remediation practices that are consistent with good practices for environmental protection in general. In that regard, the reuse of natural materials, such as saw dust, wood chips, bark, and compost, that would otherwise go to waste has been a motive for creating fillings for ERBs. Especially in consideration of the use of ERBs in functions where the filling has a requirement that is more than structural; moreover where the filling must perform additional multiple functions, such as clarification of runoff water and removal of pollutants, the targeted and judicious selection of materials tailored for such multifunctional use throughout the lifetime of the ERBs still remains a challenge. Accordingly, a need exists for more effective compositions of materials that are multifunctional for a variety of environmental remediation needs, and for a range of ERBs utilizing such compositions and their use."
9615657,Corner joint for modular portable stand,2015-06-25,1,1,"TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the field of stands, and specifically to stands used for indoor gardening or aquatics that require no tools or additional hardware when assembling or disassembling. The present invention relates to knock-down portable stands, such as used to support heavy items at level elevations, and the invention aims to provide a portable stand of modular construction that easily assembles and disassembles without the need for tools and without requiring fasteners or hardware of any type. Indoor gardeners utilize trays for starting, propagating, and growing plants. Ebb & flow or drip system gardeners often load a tray with plants, growing media, and water, which in aggregate can become too heavy for the common card table or plastic fold out table to support. Leaving the tray on the ground is not a good option as the standard placement of the water reservoir is directly below the tray. Having the tray elevated for easier plant tending is further desired to make the growing process more enjoyable for the user, and accessible for the disabled grower. A stand used for growing plants that supports a propagation tray must maintain the tray at a level elevation to facilitate complete draining of water and nutrient solutions from the growing media and tray. As the bottom of the tray must be level to the ground in order to optimize ebb and flow gardening practice, the stand that holds the tray must be sturdy enough to prevent the tray from flexing or tilting, keeping the tray level and undistorted. Like a stand used in propagation of plants, a stand used for fish tank support must also maintain a level elevation, and be strong enough to hold the weight of an aquarium, full of water, fish, and rock, with over head lights, pumps, and other components necessary for indoor aquatic practice located either above, below, or on the stand. As the nature of aquatics and growing plants includes the presence of water, the stand must not only be strong and rigid when assembled, but also resistant to water damage, and will not fail if occasionally soaked or saturated, which makes stands constructed of wood or wood composite materials undesirable. A stand that is easy to assemble and disassemble, with the benefit of breaking it down simply to fit into a compact storage area is greatly desired. With the disabled user in mind, the assembly and disassembly process should be easy to understand with no small fasteners or hardware that would be difficult to secure with arthritis or joint pain. Ideally, no tools or hardware would be required. A recent answer to the ‘stand’ problem presented has been products similar to the “Gorilla Tray Stand” that require fixating a plurality of small threaded fasteners to assemble or disassemble. The structure of the stand itself holds the tray level to the ground, is rigid, and allows for easy moving. However, the short comings of this tray stand is the complicated assembly instructions, difficult to fasten bolts and screws, difficult disassembly, all requiring the use of specialized tools. Hence, it can be seen in the indoor gardening and indoor aquatics industry, especially for ebb and flow or drip gardening practices, that there is a need for an improved modular stand, capable of securing a propagation tray or fish tank such that it remains level and elevated to the ground, provides space under the tray or tank for a reservoir or the like, allows accessibility from all sides, is mobile, and easily assembled and disassembled. Further, other fields of art also benefit from a stand that is versatile in application and robust in design as described herein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The stand assembles easily without tools, additional hardware, or complicated instructions. In the preferred modular embodiment, the stand has four frame rails with each opposing frame rail having identical construction. At each corner there is a leg that facilitates the interlocking of the frame rails without fasteners, each able to receive a wheel or caster on the ground end. The entire stand disassembles by pulling up on each side rail and removing the legs, allowing the stand to quickly break down. The components are long and flat allowing for compact storage or easy packing for travel or transport. The stand can support great weights, and with the addition of cross supports, the loading capacities can be significantly increased. The cross supports fixate either on the top of the frame when used as a table top, or on the bottom of the frame when used to support a fish tank or propagation tray. When used as a propagation tray stand the device provides 360 degree access to items supported on or within the stand and items located below the stand. In the disclosed embodiment described herein, the stand is of just one specific application as a mobile plant tray stand for growing plants, whereby the plant tray fittingly inserts from the top and rests on the frame and within the stand, while a reservoir is located below to facilitate ebb and flow type gardening practice. One skilled in the art will quickly realize that many other uses and applications are readily available for the stand, including but not in any way limited to a quick to assemble table, fish tank stand, marketing display, or moving dolly. OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES These and other advantages and features of the present invention are described herein so as to make the present invention understandable to one of ordinary skill in the art: 1. Versatile in application 2. Robust in construction 3. Only eight components: four frame rails and four legs 4. Only three unique components: base frame, side frame, and leg 5. Optional cross bars easily attach sides for increasing loading capacity 6. Interlocking at the corners provides a rigid and sturdy stand 7. Rigidity and strength increase with added load 8.
