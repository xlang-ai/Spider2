4921024,Method and apparatus to fell a tree,1989-10-16,1,0," A method and apparatus to fell a tree is disclosed. A vehicle mountable felling head includes a circular saw mounted to the felling head. A guard overlays the circular saw as a safety measure. The guard has a first portion which is fixed. The fixed portion of the guard has an opening exposing a first arcuate portion of the saw. The guard also has a second, movable portion which overlays a second arcuate portion of the circular saw. The second portion of the guard may be raised to expose a second arcuate portion of the circular saw to cut a slot in one side of a tree with the cut being completed by the first arcuate portion thereby allowing a tree greater in diameter than the radius of the circular saw to be severed.

8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,0,1,"An irrigation control device having a modulator that modulates data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation control device further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface."
