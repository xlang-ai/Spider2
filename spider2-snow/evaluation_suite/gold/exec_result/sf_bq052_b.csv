4921024,Method and apparatus to fell a tree,1989-10-16,1,0,"This invention relates to a method and apparatus to sever a standing tree from its base, specifically the invention relates to a circular saw and a saw guard mounted on a vehicle to sever a tree by advancing the saw toward the tree. Many devices have been developed for felling trees. Some of these devices have been incorporated into self propelled mechanisms by mounting the felling head on a vehicle. The one thing all of the machines have in common is that a mechanism is provided to sever the tree from its base. Large shears, reciprocating saw blades, various configurations of chain saw blades and circular saws all have been used with some success. Generally the devices which use circular saws have a guard or housing about the circular saw blade to protect the operator and other personnel from the saw blade. An opening is usually provided in the front portion of the guard to expose a portion of the saw blade for cutting the tree. This arrangement, however, limits the diameter of the tree which can be cut. One method to cut oversize trees was to partially cut the front side of a tree, drive the felling apparatus to the back of the tree and complete the severing from the backside of the tree. This method is time consuming and often is not practical because of the density of most woodlots. Kurelek, U.S. Pat. No. 4,446,897, recognized the mobility problem and mounted the circular saw and felling head on a boom which is attached to a vehicle. Kurelek also placed a second opening in the saw guard to allow the saw blade to cut on either side. The Kurelek apparatus was thus able to cut in a straight ahead mode or in a side-swing or scything mode. Although an improvement over the prior art the Kurelek patent has the disadvantage of leaving the second portion of the saw blade exposed and unprotected. Kurelek also does not address the problem of felling an oversize tree. The present invention thus overcomes the limitations and problems in the prior art. The present invention includes a felling head mounted on a vehicle. The felling head includes a frame having an upper portion and a lower portion. A bunching arm is attached to the upper portion of the frame and a circular saw is supported by the lower portion of the frame. A guard overlays the circular saw. The guard has a first or fixed portion attached to the frame and a second or movable portion hinged to the first portion. A means to move the second portion of the guard has its first end attached to the frame and its second end attached to the second portion of the guard. An opening is provided in the fixed portion of the guard to expose a first arcuate portion of the circular saw. The second portion of the guard, when raised, exposes a second arcuate portion of the circular saw. To sever a large tree, the guard is raised and the second arcuate portion of the circular saw is advanced in a first direction to cut a first side of the tree. The vehicle is reversed, bringing the circular saw out of engagement with the tree. The vehicle is then advanced in a second direction which is at an angle to the first direction bringing the first arcuate portion of the saw into cutting engagement with the second side of the tree to completely sever the tree. It is an object of the invention to provide a mobile apparatus to fell a tree, the apparatus having a circular saw mounted thereon which can fell a tree larger in diameter than the radius of the saw. It is a further object of the invention to provide a guard about the circular saw, the guard having a movable portion which can selectively either expose or overlay a portion of the circular saw. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof and from the attached drawings."
8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,0,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation devices, and more particularly to the communication of data using an alternating power signal to be supplied to irrigation devices. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Typical irrigation control systems cooperate with water valves and pumps to control the flow of irrigation water through a variety of water dispensing devices, including sprinklers, rotors, drip-lines, and other water delivery devices. These control systems are used in a wide variety of irrigation applications, from residential and commercial landscapes to golf course and agricultural irrigation. Many irrigation systems and electronics are powered by 50/60 Hz AC voltage signals. Some systems further modulate this power source to provide data communication, for example, by selectively clipping the positive half of the AC voltage signal. Data and power sent in this manner are often over a two-wire transmission line and are often referred to as a two-wire interface. Irrigation devices variously located in the field couple to the two-wire interface and derive their operational power therefrom. The irrigation devices demodulate the data monitoring the received power signal for a missing negative half of a cycle, then taking eight voltage samples at a predetermined time thereafter during the positive half to detect whether the signal is clipped or unclipped. Such systems are well known in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,395 to Evelyn-Veere. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for providing power and data to an irrigation device. The method includes modulating data onto an alternating power signal by distorting an amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, permitting effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and applying the alternating power signal to a multi-wire interface configured to couple with a plurality of irrigation devices. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system. The method includes receiving an alternating power signal comprising cycles each having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and demodulating data represented by the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device having a modulator configured to modulate data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation controller further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface. In still yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation device having an input configured to receive an alternating power signal comprising cycles having a first leading portion and a following portion, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal, and a demodulator configured to provide data by demodulating the alternating power signal based upon whether the first leading portion of a cycle of the alternating power signal has an amplitude that is distorted and where the following portion has an amplitude that is undistorted. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for use in an irrigation system, the method comprising: receiving, at an irrigation device, an alternating power signal comprising cycles, where an amplitude of a portion of each cycle is selectively distorted to modulate data on the alternating power signal; determining a slope of the portion of each cycle; and demodulating the data based upon the determining the slope"
