5617636,Trail blazing stumpcutter,1995-06-30, The instant device consists of a circular top plate made of ALMAG 35 aluminum and magnesium alloy material with a centerhole and three through holes near its rim and 120.degree. apart from one another into which three cylindrically shaped pins have been tightly pressed. Three identical beveled metallic blades with rounded holes in them are swivably received one each by the pins. A circular bottom plate also made of such ALMAG 35 material has a centerhole and three broken holes for receipt of the bottoms of the pins when the device is fully assembled plate to plate and held with a bolt and nut from below the bottom plate via the centerholes and adapter means to the rotatory head of a motorized brush cutting unit. A centrally located elevation upward in the bottom plate co-extensive with two convex ridges on its top surface fits into a centrally positioned cylindrical well in the bottom side of the top plate co-extensive with two concave depressions in the wall of the well as the depressions concomitantly receive the ridges thereby sandwiching the blades and pins during completed assembly of the invention to the rotatory head. A left handed nut serves to secure the fully assembled invention intact and the nut is self tightening during counterclockwise head rotation. ,1,0

6299663,Granulation method and apparatus therefor,1998-05-11," Granulated particles by making use an initial feedstock having particle size of -150 mesh and 90% or greater particle size of 200 mesh. The feedstock may be contacted in a pan granulator which includes a minor amount of nucleating material of about -35 mesh. Binder is introduced into the pan granulator to progressively layer the feedstock material onto the nucleating to form a final granular fertilizer or other product in any desired size distribution. The method by which the granules are formed is interruptible and is particularly useful for forming granules having a plurality of layers of differing material. The granules, by formation with dust feedstock and in the absence of seed material, lack a core and therefore include the maximum amount of tightly packed feedstock. This results in substantial increases in the break strength of the granules with uniform homogeneous cross-sections. Such granules overcome the limitations associated with existing granules to provide an industrially valuable product. ",1,0

6398185,Water flow timer,2000-12-04,"A water flow timer including a main body, a water stopping membrane, a control rod, a bottom cover, a control member, a rotating member, a timing member, and a rotary cap. The timer is mechanically operated in such a way that the rotary cap is turned to actuate the control member to force the control rod to slide, thereby resulting in a gap between the water stopping membrane and a bottom opening of an inner chamber of the main body. The inner and the outer chamber of the main body are thus in communication with each other. As the rotary cap is turned, the torsion spring of the timing member is compressed to provide the rotary cap with a recovery force. The recovery of the rotary cap is delayed by an intermittent gear, so as to control the timing of the water flow.",1,0
