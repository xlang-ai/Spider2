5617636,Trail blazing stumpcutter,1995-06-30,1,0, The instant device consists of a circular top plate made of ALMAG 35 aluminum and magnesium alloy material with a centerhole and three through holes near its rim and 120.degree. apart from one another into which three cylindrically shaped pins have been tightly pressed. Three identical beveled metallic blades with rounded holes in them are swivably received one each by the pins. A circular bottom plate also made of such ALMAG 35 material has a centerhole and three broken holes for receipt of the bottoms of the pins when the device is fully assembled plate to plate and held with a bolt and nut from below the bottom plate via the centerholes and adapter means to the rotatory head of a motorized brush cutting unit. A centrally located elevation upward in the bottom plate co-extensive with two convex ridges on its top surface fits into a centrally positioned cylindrical well in the bottom side of the top plate co-extensive with two concave depressions in the wall of the well as the depressions concomitantly receive the ridges thereby sandwiching the blades and pins during completed assembly of the invention to the rotatory head. A left handed nut serves to secure the fully assembled invention intact and the nut is self tightening during counterclockwise head rotation. 
5788450,Narrow self-propelled transportation apparatus,1996-07-05,1,0," Machine for picking up limb and trunk portions of trees and other types of vegetation and transporting the portions through narrow passageways like a chain link gate. This machine is especially useful in populated areas for collecting branches and tree trunks from pruning or removal operations and moving them from closely spaced backyards or houses, walks and narrow gates to a truck at the curb of a street without damage to the lawns or walks. "
6299663,Granulation method and apparatus therefor,1998-05-11,1,0," Granulated particles by making use an initial feedstock having particle size of -150 mesh and 90% or greater particle size of 200 mesh. The feedstock may be contacted in a pan granulator which includes a minor amount of nucleating material of about -35 mesh. Binder is introduced into the pan granulator to progressively layer the feedstock material onto the nucleating to form a final granular fertilizer or other product in any desired size distribution. The method by which the granules are formed is interruptible and is particularly useful for forming granules having a plurality of layers of differing material. The granules, by formation with dust feedstock and in the absence of seed material, lack a core and therefore include the maximum amount of tightly packed feedstock. This results in substantial increases in the break strength of the granules with uniform homogeneous cross-sections. Such granules overcome the limitations associated with existing granules to provide an industrially valuable product. "
6506243,Environmentally preferred fluids and fluid blends,1999-05-05,1,0,"The invention concerns fluids that have a low reactivity with respect to ozone formation, blends thereof, and the replacement of conventional industrial solvents with said fluid or fluid blends in order to reduce tropospheric ozone formation."
6398185,Water flow timer,2000-12-04,1,0,"A water flow timer including a main body, a water stopping membrane, a control rod, a bottom cover, a control member, a rotating member, a timing member, and a rotary cap. The timer is mechanically operated in such a way that the rotary cap is turned to actuate the control member to force the control rod to slide, thereby resulting in a gap between the water stopping membrane and a bottom opening of an inner chamber of the main body. The inner and the outer chamber of the main body are thus in communication with each other. As the rotary cap is turned, the torsion spring of the timing member is compressed to provide the rotary cap with a recovery force. The recovery of the rotary cap is delayed by an intermittent gear, so as to control the timing of the water flow."
7422682,"Compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation",2005-06-28,1,0,"What is disclosed are compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation. The compositions are for use in a variety of environmental remediation barriers including fiber rolls, mats or blankets, and berms. Applications for the use of the compositions, devices, and methods include remediation of runoff water, of livestock waste, of eutrification of waterways, and for the revetment of banks."
8260465,Data communication in a multi-wire irrigation control system,2009-07-17,0,1,"An irrigation control device having a modulator that modulates data onto an alternating power signal by distorting amplitude of a first leading portion of selected cycles of the alternating power signal, and permit effectively a full amplitude of the alternating power signal on a following portion of the selected cycles, wherein the first leading portion and the following portion are either both on a high side of a cycle or both on a low side of a cycle of the alternating power signal. The irrigation control device further includes an interface configured to couple the modulator to a multi-wire interface coupled to a plurality of irrigation devices to permit the alternating power signal to be applied to the multi-wire interface."
8851447,Integrated control circuitry and coil assembly for irrigation control,2009-07-27,2,0,An integrated irrigation valve control device has a coil adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of irrigation equipment. Control circuitry is electrically coupled to the coil to control the flux at the coil. A housing covers at least a portion of the coil and at least a portion of the control circuitry.
8813370,Trigger-operated portable electric tool,2009-08-19,1,0,"A trigger-operated portable electric tool for performing a main function, characterized in that it has a double trigger with, on the one hand, a main trigger for operating it, which operates at least one moving active part of the tool and, on the other hand, an auxiliary trigger or secondary trigger connected to the main trigger by means of an articulation and configured to make an angle with the said main trigger, the pivoting of the auxiliary trigger about the articulation enabling actuation of a means of operating a system for performing at least one additional function of the tool."
10638669,Photon modulation management system,2015-08-27,1,0,"Embodiments described herein provide systems for inducing a desired response in an organism by controlling the duty cycle, wavelength band and frequency of photon bursts to an organism, through the photon modulation of one or more photon pulse trains in conjunction with one or more different photon pulse trains to the organism and duty cycle, where the photon modulation and duty cycle is based upon the specific needs of the organism. Devices for inducing a desired response in an organism such as growth, destruction or repair through the photon modulation of one or more photon pulse trains in conjunction with one or more different photon pulse trains to the organism are also provided. Further provided are methods for the optimization of organism growth, destruction or repair through the use of high frequency modulation of photons of individual color spectrums."
