"- The macro _is_ smart enough to ignore items. So blocks within local `fn`s, `impl`s, etc are safe. This should speed up parsing a bit too -- as soon as the macro sees e.g. the keyword `impl` it can skip an entire item without copying over every token or descending into token trees.",1,Rust
"- The macro recurses. A lot. This means it will slow down compilation proportional to the length of the code in the block. You may need to increase the recursion limit (stick `#![recursion_limit = ""1000""]` at the crate root, playing with the number as necessary).",1,Rust

"Goal #1: provide the AEC industry with an easy, free, and open source means of publishing 3D content on the web. The Spectacles platform allows users to export .json files from common AEC authoring applications that can be opened with the Spectacles viewer. The viewer comes in two flavors. One is a full page web application served from github.io that can open .json files from a user’s machine. The second flavor is an embeddable viewer that can be included in any html page. Both viewers will provide a minimal user interface to allow for easy model navigation and intuitive element investigation.",1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript"
"Goal #2: build a general, extensible viewer app that can be forked to build more bespoke, use-case-specific applications. Besides it’s out of the box functionality as a model viewer, Spectacles can be seen as a foundation project that is meant to be forked by power users to build other apps; the viewer can be easily customized, extended, hacked. Spectacles should provide the lowest common denominator in terms of it’s UI and code base. It should have all of the features that all good AEC viewers should have, and ideally, nothing more. Which of course begs the question - what features should all AEC model viewers have? Opinions vary from camp to camp, and pinning down this specification is likely going to be one of the most challenging aspects of the project.",1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript"

内置存储引擎包括`memory`，`redis`，`memcache`，`local`。,1,"HTML, JavaScript, Shell"
可供在浏览器上使用的文件存放在`dist`目录,1,"HTML, JavaScript, Shell"
在public文件夹下新建lib文件夹，表示bower下载文件的存放路径,1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Makefile, Ruby"
"在学习、使用egret-3d,webgl期间得到白鹭egret-3d开发者BlackSwan的不少帮助，在此感谢。",1,"GLSL, HTML, JavaScript, Shell, TypeScript"
在效率没有明显提升的情况下，递归表达意图的能力，实在是让人无法割舍。,1,"C++, Python"
"在项目根目录下新建.bowerrc文件并写入引用路径 {""directory"":""./public/lib""}  //表示以此为引用的根",1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Makefile, Ruby"
如果你喜欢Hui，可以点击右上角的`star`，想实时关注进度，可以点击右上角的`watch`。,1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript"
如果你觉得 Hui 对你有价值，并且愿意让她继续成长下去，你可以资助这个项目的开发，为作者加油打气。,1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript"
存储引擎需要实现以下接口：,1,"HTML, JavaScript, Shell"
希望抛砖引玉，了解更多的方案。,1,"C++, Python"
我能想到的方法就是设一个 bool 成员变量，然后一旦为 false， 立刻停止。这就是目前我的方案了。,1,"C++, Python"
所以我几乎是瞬间写出了[解决方法](../../e6906ef932bda154ad17518e6d097c904045048f/22.%20Balanced%20Binary%20Tree/solution.h#L22-L32)（递归真的是人类自然而然的思路呀）。,1,"C++, Python"
所以这个问题很重要的一个子问题就是：如何求二叉树的高度。假设我们找到了高度的方法，那么核心判断就是：,1,"C++, Python"
新的cmd cd mongo/bin  mongo,1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Makefile, Ruby"
最后，感谢每一个提建议和使用或者捐赠的朋友！因为你们，我们才能坚持！也是因为你们，未来才会更美好！,1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript"
最近持续不断的做有关 **tree** 的题目，让我深深感觉到，在树算法中，不用递归简直是找死，自建栈也好，自建队列也好，,1,"C++, Python"
滚轮选择器效果,1,Java
由于egret-3d本身不完善，因此对引擎代码有少量定制化修改([见我的egret-3d分支](https://github.com/aceway/egret-3d))和扩展(见./src/game/ExtraE3D.ts)。,1,"GLSL, HTML, JavaScript, Shell, TypeScript"
由于一个项目需要，我从网上找了一个类似，并改写了其中的代码开源出来。,1,Java
运用express搭建的博客,1,"CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Makefile, Ruby"
这个是个人业余学习H5 3D时实现的代码，所以会存在疏忽、错误，欢迎微信，QQ，邮件反馈讨论。,1,"GLSL, HTML, JavaScript, Shell, TypeScript"
这道题，我昨天就在想了。毕竟平衡搜索树只不过是特殊的平衡二叉树罢了。是否平衡的关键在于题目里给出的这个定义：,1,"C++, Python"
都要维护一大堆东西，在效率上不仅没有显著的提升，反而让程序晦涩难懂，表意不明。如何抉择呢？我一定还是偏向于使用递归的。,1,"C++, Python"
