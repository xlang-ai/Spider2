            "Title": "Denial of service in Tendermint",
            "Description": "### Description\n\n**Denial of Service 1**\n\nTendermint 0.33.2 and earlier does not limit the number of P2P connection requests. For each p2p connection, Tendermint allocates XXX bytes. Even though this memory is garbage collected once the connection is terminated (due to duplicate IP or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary memory spikes can lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions. \n\nTendermint 0.33.3 (and 0.32.10) limits the total number of P2P incoming connection requests to to `p2p.max_num_inbound_peers + len(p2p.unconditional_peer_ids)`.\n\nNotes:\n\n- Tendermint does not rate limit P2P connection requests per IP (an attacker can saturate all the inbound slots);\n- Tendermint does not rate limit HTTP(S) requests. If you expose any RPC endpoints to the public, please make sure to put in place some protection (https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/). We may implement this in the future (https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1696).\n\n**Denial of Service 2**\n\nTendermint 0.33.2 and earlier does not reclaim `activeID` of a peer after it's removed in `Mempool` reactor. This does not happen all the time. It only happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the `Peer` is created and added to all reactors. `RemovePeer` is therefore called before `AddPeer`, which leads to always growing memory (`activeIDs` map). The `activeIDs` map has a maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the maximum. An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting Denial of Service 1), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking.\n\nTendermint 0.33.3 (and 0.32.10) claims `activeID` for a peer in `InitPeer`, which is executed before `MConnection` is started.\n\nNotes: \n\n- `InitPeer` function was added to all reactors to combat a similar issue - https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3338;\n- Denial of Service 2 is independent of Denial of Service 1 and can be executed without it.\n\n### Impact\n\n- All full nodes (except for validators who are behind closed networks)\n- Node's memory usage increases, then it panics either in the mempool or due to OOM.\n\n### Patches\n\n- v0.33.3\n- v0.32.10\n- v0.31.12\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds.\n\n### References\n\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/820317 (not disclosed yet)\n- https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3338\n- https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1696\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [tendermint/tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)\n* Email us at [security@tendermint.com](mailto:security@tendermint.com)\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://tendermint.com/security/).\n\n### Credits\n\n- [fudongbai](https://hackerone.com/fudongbai) for discovering and reporting Denial of Service 2\n- Ethan Buchman (@ebuchman) for writing a test case for Denial of Service 2 and Tess Rinearson (@tessr) for fixing it\n- Anton Kaliaev (@melekes) for fixing Denial of Service 1",

            "Description": "### Context\nContent Security Policies (CSP) are a defense-in-depth strategy against XSS attacks. Improper application of CSP isn't itself a vulnerability, but it does fail to prevent XSS in the event that there is a viable attack vector for an XSS attack.\n\n### Impact\nThere aren't any XSS attack vectors via the Apollo Server landing pages _known to Apollo_, so to our knowledge there is no impact. However, if there are existing XSS vectors that haven't been reported and patched, then all users of Apollo Server's landing pages have a vulnerability which won't be prevented by the current CSP implemented by the landing pages.\n\nPrior to version 4.7.1, there was no CSP implemented at all. However, the initial CSP implementation (4.7.1+) reused nonces. While this sufficiently resolved the issue w.r.t. scripts not running in Safari, it did not implement CSP in a safe or conventional way.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is patched in the latest version of Apollo Server, v4.7.4. The changes can be reviewed in [the merge commit](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/0adaf80d1ee51d8c7e5fd863c04478536d15eb8c).\n\n### Workarounds\nThe landing page can be disabled completely until the patch can be upgraded to.\nhttps://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/#disabling-the-landing-page\n\n### References\nhttps://content-security-policy.com/nonce/",

If your application is sandboxed then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs (which includes `ipcRenderer`).\n\nIf your application then additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation that perform privileged actions or return confidential data this access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your application / user even with the sandbox enabled.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched and the following Electron versions contain the fix:\n\n* `18.0.0-beta.6`\n* `17.2.0`\n* `16.2.6`\n* `15.5.5`\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure that all IPC message handlers appropriately validate `senderFrame` as per our [security tutorial here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/tutorial/security.md#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).",
