Based on this finding, N3-methyl-mafosfamide was synthesized and examined as a chemically stable, biooxidative prodrug of mafosfamide. This prodrug was stable in aqueous buffer (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C) and underwent N-demethylation in a time dependent manner when incubated with rat hepatic microsomes. N3-Methyl-mafosfamide was 10-fold more cytotoxic in vitro than cyclophosphamide against mouse embryo Balb/c 3T3 cells (LC50 = 3.6 microM). Preliminary in vivo antitumor evaluation against L1210 leukemia in mice showed that this prodrug was active [Increase of life span (ILS) > 29%].",
