            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ralstonia solanacearum, one of the most important bacterial diseases on plants, is a devastating, soil-borne plant pathogen with a global distribution and an unusually wide host range. In order to discover new bioactive molecules and pesticides acting on tobacco bacterial wilt, we sought to combine the active structure of hydrazone and pyridine together to design and synthesize a series of novel hydrazone derivatives containing a pyridine moiety. RESULTS: A series of hydrazone derivatives containing a pyridine moiety were synthesized. Their structures were characterized by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, IR, and elemental analysis. The preliminary biological activity tests showed that compound 3e and 3g exhibited more than 80% activity against Ralstonia solanacearum at 500 mg/L, especially compound 3g displayed relatively good activity to reach 57.0% at 200 mg/L. CONCLUSION: A practical synthetic route to hydrazone derivatives containing a pyridine moiety by the reaction of intermediates 2 with different aldehydes in ethanol at room temperature using 2-chloronicotinic acid and 2-amino-5-chloro-3-methylbenzoic acid as start materials is presented. This study suggests that the hydrazone derivatives containing a substituted pyridine ring could inhibit the growth of Ralstonia solanacearum.",

            "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of drugs failing during clinical trials and being withdrawn from the market. Comparative analysis of drugs based on their DILI potential is an effective approach to discover key DILI mechanisms and risk factors. However, assessing the DILI potential of a drug is a challenge with no existing consensus methods. We proposed a systematic classification scheme using FDA-approved drug labeling to assess the DILI potential of drugs, which yielded a benchmark dataset with 287 drugs representing a wide range of therapeutic categories and daily dosage amounts. The method is transparent and reproducible with a potential to serve as a common practice to study the DILI of marketed drugs for supporting drug discovery and biomarker development.",

Many compounds in this series were found to be potent inhibitors of IL-1 generation both in vitro and in vivo. Structure-activity relationships indicated that in the rat CMC-LPS air-pouch model by oral administration the (Z)-2-substituted propenoic acids with 3-alkoxy, 5-alkyl, and 4-hydroxy substituents on the naphthalene ring exhibit optimal inhibition. Among the compounds evaluated, (Z)-3-(5-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-1-naphthalenyl)-2-methyl-2-propeno ic acid (20a), which inhibited IL-1 generation from human monocytes with an IC50 value of 3.0 microM and had an IC50 value of 1.4 microM for rat exudated macrophages, showed the most potent inhibitory activity in the rat CMC-LPS model by oral administration. Compound 20a also showed antiinflammatory effects in animal models of inflammation.",

The sensitivity of these serotypes to this series varied and was dependent upon the length of the molecule as well as upon the flexibility of the aliphatic chain. Minimum energy conformations of these compounds were overlaid with the X-ray structure of a closely related analog 9 bound to the capsid protein of both HRV-14 and -1A and then modeled in the compound-binding site of both serotypes. A comparative sweep volume of these compounds about the isoxazole ring revealed an inaccessible region of space for the cis-olefin 8b, which is not the case for either the trans-olefin 8a or the acetylene 5. This region may be important to the binding of the compounds to the HRV-14 site particularly during entry into the pocket.",
