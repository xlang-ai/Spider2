The logP = 2.7 +/- 0.2 between n-octanol and water, has been estimated by UV spectrophotometry.

The inhibition profile was found to be competitive for compounds 3k, 3m, 5f and 5n with MAO-A selectivity. Observation of the docked positions of these compounds revealed interactions with many residues previously reported to have an effect on the inhibition of the enzyme. The structural features of the new compounds have been determined from the microanalytical, IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR spectral studies and X-ray crystalography.",

The conversion of the peptide inhibitor 1 into cell-permeable peptidomimetic inhibitors of BACE was achieved through an iterative strategy of conceptually subdividing 1 into three regions: an N-terminal portion, a central statine-containing core, and a C-terminus. Replacement of the amino acid residues of 1 with moieties with less peptidic character was done with retention of BACE enzyme inhibitory activity. This approach led to the identification of the cell-permeable BACE inhibitor 38 that demonstrated BACE-mechanism-selective inhibition of Abeta secretion in human embryonic kidney cells.",

            "abstract": "Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have been associated with several inflammatory diseases, and therefore, strategies for its suppression have become important targets in drug discovery. Our efforts to suppress TNF-alpha have centered on the inhibition of TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) through the use of hydroxamate inhibitors. Starting from broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, we have designed and synthesized novel benzothiadiazepines as potent and selective TACE inhibitors. The benzothiadiazepines were synthesized with variation in P1 and P1' in order to effect potency and selectivity. The inhibitors were evaluated versus porcine TACE (pTACE), and the initial selectivity was assessed with counterscreens of MMP-1, -2, and -9. Several potent and selective inhibitors were discovered with compound 41 being the most active against pTACE (K(i) = 5 nM) while still maintaining good selectivity versus the MMP's (at least 75-fold). Most compounds were assessed in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cell assay (PBMC) and the human whole blood assay (WBA) to determine their ability to suppress TNF-alpha. Compound 32 was the most potent compound in the PBMC assay (IC(50) = 0.35 microM), while compound 62 was the most active in the WBA (IC(50) = 1.4 microM).",
