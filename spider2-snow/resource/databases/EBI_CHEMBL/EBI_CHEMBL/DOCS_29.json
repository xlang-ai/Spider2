The most active compound, 3d, shows a modest inhibition of the [3H]estradiol receptor interaction and causes a marked effect on the growth of the hormone-dependent human MCF 7 breast cancer cell line. It is also active on the hormone-independent human MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell line, on the ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma of the Balb/C mouse, and on the L 5222 leukemia of the BD IX rat. Apparently the inhibition of the MCF 7 cell line is not mediated by the estrogen receptor system. Histopathological studies on 3d revealed very low toxicity.",

They belong either to 2-hydroxy-3-(tert-butylamino)propyl ether A or 2-hydroxy-3-tert-(butylamino)propyl ketoxime ether B derivatives. The O-[2-hydroxy-3-(tert-butylamino)propyl] dicyclopropyl ketoxime 5 exhibited a beta-adrenergic antagonist activity comparable to that of propranolol. It was found that ketoxime ethers B generally showed higher potency than the corresponding ethers A. We confirm that the presence of an aromatic nucleus is not crucial for the beta-adrenergic activity. Structure-activity relationships among these series are discussed.",

All synthesized compounds showed no appreciable effect on platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate, but most of them inhibited effectively the arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation. The parent compound, 2-phenyl derivatives, and ortho-substituted 2-phenyl derivatives show the most potent inhibition of all compounds.",

Tris(galactosyloxymethyl)-aminomethane is coupled to cholesterol by using glycyl and succinyl as intermediate hydrophilic spacer moieties. The resulting cholesteryl ester dissolves easily in water, forming monodisperse micelles. When added to dispersions of liposomes or plasma lipoproteins in water, the substance becomes incorporated rapidly into these structures, causing an increase of their buoyant density. Liposomes or low-density lipoproteins, preloaded with the substance, are rapidly cleared from the circulation and taken up by the liver after intravenous injection in rats. This uptake is inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine but not by N-acetylglucosamine, indicating the specificity of this process.",
