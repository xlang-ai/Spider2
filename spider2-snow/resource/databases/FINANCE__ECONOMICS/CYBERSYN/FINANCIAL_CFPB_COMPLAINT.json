However, XXXX XXXX is a urgent care facility and this debt has been PAID IN FULL -- as they will not treat a patient ( my minor daughter ), if there are ANY OUTSTANDING DEBTS on the account. This account was paid when I visited XXXX XXXX again with my daughter. \n\nReceivables Management Systems did not provide enough information on my credit report for me to VERIFY the debt. For example, there is NO ACCOUNT NUMBER referenced, no \" TYPE '' of accou8nt, and I've repeatedly tried to DISPUTE this account with both XXXX and XXXX on numerous occasions. \n\nSo let me ask, if there is NO WAY for a consumer to reference an account number to any payments made, how are ANY accounts being appropriately debited for payments received by consumers? \n\nShould the CFPB allow Receivables Management Systems to continue to collect debt and falsify credit reports of consumers by making it impossible for consumers to prove their debt with this collection agency has been resolved, paid in full, or even settled? If there is no account numbers reported, this company can literally be accepting payments from consumers all across the USA and never reflecting the payment ( s ) on their accounts.\n\nXXXX   has had this dispute open for SEVERAL MONTHS without resolve. \n\nIs there a law regarding how long a company has to prove a dispute to be correct or incorrect? I thought this federal law was 30 days??? Why is this company STILL REPORTING I OWE MONEY TO THEM on two out of three credit reporting companies?\n\nAnd in addition to all of this, when you go to their website http : //rmscollect.com/ and click on PAY ONLINE, the very 1st question is \" Account Number '' -- and it's a required field to move forward. This collection has been on my credit report FOR THREE YEARS -- even though I've continuously disputed it -- and it has NEVER REPORTED an account number.",
