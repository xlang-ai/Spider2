            "Description": "## Task Details\nWe are sharing the latest BCG Atlas data and various texts related to BCG vaccine policies around the world. The goal of the task is to try to **improve and to extend the existing BCG World Atlas data** and to get a fuller picture of the administration of the vaccine. All data that is collected during this task will support the work of the BCG Atlas team, and it will also help with the analysis of the second task of the hackathon. \nThe current BCG data is stored in  file.  The task is to try to find snippets that answer some of these questions. All the questions are listed as columns. Specifically, we would like to get as many accurate answers as possible to the following questions, for as many countries or regions as possible:\n- Which BCG strain over the years has been used in different countries since the creation of the vaccine and during what time periods?\n- Who are or were the target group of the vaccine, and when and at what age were they vaccinated?\n- Have revaccinations (boosters) been given and if yes, when and at what age?\n \nIn the following spreadsheet are listed a couple of sample records - [BCG policy data hackathon sample google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nrzrAy0vC43Iy9QaKA5pR83O3YW3I16pXFjnOt86j5I/edit#gid=67941157). The new records which were added in addition to the existing BCG data from \"BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv\" file are on line 3, 6 and 7 and are highlighted in green. Line 4 and 5 are part of the original \"BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv\" file. The first 4 columns are mandatory and the field \u201cIs it from bcgatlas.org (Mandatory field)\u201d should have the value \u201cno\u201d for all records that are added by the participants of the hackathon. \n\n## Expected Submission\nThe expected submission will be a copy of the \"BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv\"  file saved in Kaggle. The file should contain additional rows for a number of countries with snippets that contain answers to a specific question of a given column.  There should be no more than 2 new rows (data sources) per country. The snippet length should not be longer than 350* characters. For each additional row that has been added apart from the snippet(s), the first four columns are mandatory and should also be updated. A manual review is highly recommended in order to make sure that the snippets of the 2 selected data sources contain information about the specified country.\n\nParticipants must also accept our [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/bcgvaccine/hackathon). \n\n## Evaluation\nSubmissions will be scored using the following grading rubric:\n- How many answers for how many countries have been found?  \n- Are the snippets relevant?   \n- Is the methodology well documented and if the code easy to read and reuse?  \n\n## Timeline\nStart date (June 8, 2020)\nSubmission deadline (July 25, 2020) at 11:59pm UTC.**\n\n## Prizes\n- First prize $3,000\n- Second prize $2,000\n- Third prize $1,000\n\n## Winners\n- First place - Dimitrina Zlatkova - contributed 57 additional\nentries data points\n- Second place - Marouane Benmeida - contributed 33 additional\nentries data points\n\n\n[*] 22 June, updated the length from 120 to 350 characters.",

Do we also need a crew to pick up and restore all the bikes to initial distributions across the city before the next morning?\n\n## Expected Submission\n1. Find out what percentage of bikes are returned to its initial location?\n2.
