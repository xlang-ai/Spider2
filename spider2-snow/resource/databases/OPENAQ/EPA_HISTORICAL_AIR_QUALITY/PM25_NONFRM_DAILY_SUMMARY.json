So, it represents an averaging period in the atmosphere (for example, a 24-hour sample duration draws ambient air over a collection filter for 24 straight hours). For continuous monitors, it can represent an averaging time of many samples (for example, a 1-hour value may be the average of four one-minute samples collected during each quarter of the hour).",
        "The percent representing the number of observations taken with respect to the number scheduled to be taken during the day. This is only calculated for monitors where measurements are required (e.g., only certain parameters).",

A wildfire is an example of an exceptional event; it is something that affects air quality, but the local agency has no control over. No Events means no events occurred. Events Included means events occurred and the data from them is included in the summary. Events Excluded means that events occurred but data form them is excluded from the summary. Concurred Events Excluded means that events occurred but only EPA concurred exclusions are removed from the summary. If an event occurred for the parameter in question, the data will have multiple records for each monitor.",
