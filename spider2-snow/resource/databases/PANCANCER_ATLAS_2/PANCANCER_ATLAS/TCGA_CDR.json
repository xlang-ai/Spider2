        "Disease-free interval event, 1 for patient having new tumor event whether it is a local recurrence, distant metastasis, new primary tumor of the cancer, including cases with a new tumor event whose type is N/A.  Disease free was defined by: first, treatment_outcome_first_course is \"Complete Remission/Response\"; if the tumor type doesn't have \"treatment_outcome_first_course\" then disease-free was defined by the value \"R0\" in the field of \"residual_tumor\"; otherwise, disease-free was defined by the value \"negative\" in the field of \"margin_status\". If the tumor type did not have any of these fields, then its DFI was NA. 0 for censored otherwise. New primary tumor in other organ was censored; patients who were Dead with tumor without new tumor event are excluded; patients wih stage IV are excluded too.",
