Representative ultrasound image of the vessel cross section obtained from each position is presented in black and white colors. Each colored circular ring represents corresponding raw NIRF or corrected NIRF signals, and are depicted on the interior of the IVUS catheter, as well as externally around the vessel wall. FIG. 8B : Representation of the raw and corrected NIRF two dimensional images obtained in different intraluminal positions. FIG. 8C Comparison between raw and corrected NIRF signals in pullback position 6 mm. All scale bars 1 mm.",
