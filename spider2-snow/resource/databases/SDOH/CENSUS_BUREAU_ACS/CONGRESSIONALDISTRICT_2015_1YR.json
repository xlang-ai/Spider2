        "Family Households. A family consists of a householder and one or more other people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as part of the family of the householder in tabulations. Thus, the number of family households is equal to the number of families, but family households may include more members than do families.
