DBH is usually measured at 4.5 feet above the ground line on the uphill side of the tree. DRC is measured on woodland species (often multi-stemmed) at the ground line or at the stem root collar, whichever is higher. DRC is computed using the following formula: DRC = SQRT [SUM (stem diameter2)] For additional information about where the tree diameter is measured, see Diameter height code or Height to diameter measurement point. Current diameter for live trees contains the measured value. DIA for cut and dead trees presents problems associated with uncertainty of when the tree was cut or died as well as structural deterioration of dead trees.
