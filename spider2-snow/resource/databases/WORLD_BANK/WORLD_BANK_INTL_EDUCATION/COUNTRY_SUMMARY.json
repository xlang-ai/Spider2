The reference year is usually the same as the base year used to report the constant price series. However when the constant price data are chain linked the base year is changed annually so the data are rescaled to a specific reference year to provide a consistent time series. When the country has not rescaled following a change in base year World Bank staff rescale the data to maintain a longer historical series. To allow for cross-country comparison and data aggregation constant price data reported in World Development Indicators are rescaled to a common reference year (2010) and currency (U.S. dollars).",
