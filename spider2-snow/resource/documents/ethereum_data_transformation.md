### Revised Task Requirement Document

#### Overview
This document outlines the data requirements and analytical objectives for evaluating Ethereum blockchain data. The purpose is to assess various aspects of address activity including transaction behaviors, balances, and contract interactions to derive comprehensive insights into Ethereum address dynamics.

#### Data Integration and Analysis Requirements
- **Address Activity Analysis**:
  - **Objective**: Analyze the activity of each address until January 1, 2017.
  - **Methodology**: For addresses with significant activity (more than 24 activities), calculate the hourly activity consistency using trigonometric functions to gauge uniformity in activity throughout the day. This involves computing the root mean square of the sum of cosines and sines of the transaction hours, normalized by the number of transactions, to measure activity concentration.
  - **Metrics**:
    - `R_active_hour`: Consistency of hourly activity.
    - `active_days`: Number of active days for each address.

- **Balance Analysis**:
  - **Objective**: Compute the net balance for each address by considering tokens received, tokens sent, and transaction fees.
  - **Methodology**: Include successful transactions only. Exclude transactions of specific Ethereum call types (`delegatecall`, `callcode`, `staticcall`) unless they are null. Calculate the balance by subtracting the total values of tokens sent from tokens received and adjusting for transaction fees.
  - **Metrics**:
    - `balance`: Net balance of each address, adjusted for scale by dividing by \(10^{18}\) to convert from Wei to Ether.

- **Token Transaction Analysis**:
  - **Objective**: Quantify both incoming and outgoing token transactions to and from each address.
  - **Methodology**: Count the number of transactions involving token transfers, distinct types of tokens, and distinct counterparty addresses involved in these transactions.
  - **Metrics**:
    - `token_in_tnx`: Number of incoming token transactions.
    - `token_out_tnx`: Number of outgoing token transactions.
    - `token_in_type`: Types of tokens received.
    - `token_out_type`: Types of tokens sent.

- **General Transaction Analysis**:
  - **Objective**: Analyze all transactions, both incoming and outgoing, for each address.
  - **Methodology**: Calculate the total number of transactions, identify unique counterpart addresses, and measure transactions with non-zero values. For incoming transactions, specifically compute the average and standard deviation of gas used for "call" type transactions.
  - **Metrics**:
    - `in_trace_count`/`out_trace_count`: Number of incoming/outgoing transactions.
    - `in_addr_count`/`out_addr_count`: Number of unique incoming/outgoing addresses.
    - `in_transfer_count`/`out_transfer_count`: Number of incoming/outgoing transactions with non-zero value.
    - `in_avg_amount`/`out_avg_amount`: Average amount of incoming/outgoing transactions, scaled by \(10^{18}\).

- **Mining Rewards and Contract Creation Analysis**:
  - **Objective**: Summarize total mining rewards and count the number of contracts created by each address, excluding transaction fees from the rewards.
  - **Metrics**:
    - `reward_amount`: Total mining rewards received, adjusted for Wei to Ether.
    - `contract_create_count`: Number of contracts created by the address.

- **Failure and Bytecode Analysis**:
  - **Objective**: Record failures and bytecode analysis for contracts.
  - **Methodology**: Count the number of failed transactions and calculate the bytecode length for contracts created by the address.
  - **Metrics**:
    - `failure_count`: Number of failed transactions initiated by the address.
    - `bytecode_size`: Length of the bytecode for contracts associated with the address.

#### Final Report Format and Content
The final report will present a detailed analysis with the following columns:

- **Address (`address`)**: Ethereum address of the user.
- **Balance (`balance`)**: Net balance of the address, adjusted for scale by dividing by \(10^{18}\) to convert from Wei to Ether.
- **Hourly Activity Consistency (`R_active_hour`)**: Calculated value representing the uniformity of activity across different hours using trigonometric measures.
- **Active Days (`active_days`)**: Total number of days the address showed activity.
- **Incoming Trace Count (`in_trace_count`)**: Number of incoming transactions to the address.
- **Unique Incoming Addresses (`in_addr_count`)**: Number of unique addresses that have sent transactions to the address.
- **Incoming Transfers (`in_transfer_count`)**: Count of incoming transactions with non-zero value.
- **Average Incoming Amount (`in_avg_amount`)**: Average amount of incoming transactions, scaled by \(10^{18}\) to convert from Wei to Ether.
- **Average Gas Used (`avg_gas_used`)**: Average gas used in incoming "call" transactions.
- **Standard Deviation of Gas Used (`std_gas_used`)**: Standard deviation of gas used in incoming "call" transactions.
- **Outgoing Trace Count (`out_trace_count`)**: Number of outgoing transactions from the address.
- **Unique Outgoing Addresses (`out_addr_count`)**: Number of unique addresses that have received transactions from the address.
- **Outgoing Transfers (`out_transfer_count`)**: Count of outgoing transactions with non-zero value.
- **Average Outgoing Amount (`out_avg_amount`)**: Average amount of outgoing transactions, scaled by \(10^{18}\) to convert from Wei to Ether.
- **Incoming Token Transactions (`token_in_tnx`)**: Total number of token transactions received by the address.
- **Incoming Token Types (`token_in_type`)**: Number of different types of tokens received.
- **Distinct Incoming Token Senders (`token_from_addr`)**: Number of distinct addresses from which tokens were received.
- **Outgoing Token Transactions (`token_out_tnx`)**: Total number of token transactions sent by the address.
- **Outgoing Token Types (`token_out_type`)**: Number of different types of tokens sent.
- **Distinct Outgoing Token Receivers (`token_to_addr`)**: Number of distinct addresses to which tokens were sent.
- **Reward Amount (`reward_amount`)**: Total mining rewards received by the address, scaled by \(10^{18}\) to convert from Wei to Ether.
- **Contract Creation Count (`contract_create_count`)**: Number of contracts created by the address.
- **Failure Count (`failure_count`)**: Number of failed transactions initiated by the address.
- **Bytecode Size (`bytecode_size`)**: Length of the bytecode for contracts associated with the address.
