## ST_WITHIN

Returns true if the first geospatial object is fully contained by the second geospatial object. In other words:

The first GEOGRAPHY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOGRAPHY object g2.
The first GEOMETRY object g1 is fully contained by the second GEOMETRY object g2.

Calling ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) is equivalent to calling ST_CONTAINS(g2, g1).
Although ST_COVEREDBY and ST_WITHIN might seem similar, the two functions have subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covered by” and “within”, see the Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM).

Note This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection as input values.

Tip You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of queries that call this function.

## Examples


## GEOGRAPHY examples

This shows a simple use of the ST_WITHIN function:

create table geospatial_table_01 (g1 GEOGRAPHY, g2 GEOGRAPHY);
insert into geospatial_table_01 (g1, g2) values 
    ('POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0))', 'POLYGON((1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))');

Copy SELECT ST_WITHIN(g1, g2) 
    FROM geospatial_table_01;
